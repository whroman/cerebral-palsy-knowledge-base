# What is Cerebral Palsy?

Cerebral palsy is a lifelong physical disability affecting movement and posture.

This is the foundational understanding that everything else in this knowledge base builds upon.

---

## Core Definition

Cerebral palsy describes a group of permanent disorders of movement and posture, caused by non-progressive disturbances in the developing brain. The term "cerebral" refers to the brain; "palsy" refers to weakness or problems with movement.

## Prevalence

In high-income countries, cerebral palsy occurs in approximately **1.6 per 1,000 livebirths** — a 40% reduction from historical rates of 2.1 per 1,000.

Prevalence remains higher in lower-income regions.

---

## Comorbidities

Cerebral palsy rarely occurs alone. **95% of people with cerebral palsy have additional comorbidities**, including:

- Pain
- Mental health conditions
- Epilepsy
- Cognitive differences
- Sensory impairments

This means managing cerebral palsy requires attention to the whole person, not just motor function.

---

## Etiology

The causes of cerebral palsy are diverse:

- **Up to 30%** have a genetic contribution
- Prenatal factors (infections, stroke, malformations)
- Perinatal factors (birth asphyxia, prematurity)
- Postnatal factors (infections, trauma in early life)
