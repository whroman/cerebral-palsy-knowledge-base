## A

**AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication)**
Devices and methods that supplement or replace speech. Includes communication boards, speech-generating devices, and eye-gaze systems. See [Equipment & Devices](./management/equipment.md).

**AFO (Ankle-Foot Orthosis)**
A brace extending from below the knee to the foot that supports ankle positioning and improves gait. See [Equipment & Devices](./management/equipment.md).

**Aspiration**
When food, liquid, or saliva enters the airway instead of the esophagus. Common concern with dysphagia. See [Secondary Conditions](./understanding/co-occurring/secondary-conditions.md).

**Ataxic cerebral palsy**
Type characterized by problems with balance and coordination rather than stiffness.

**Athetoid/Dyskinetic cerebral palsy**
Type characterized by involuntary, uncontrolled movements.

---

## B

**Baclofen**
A muscle relaxant that reduces spasticity. Available as oral medication or via intrathecal pump. See [Spasticity Management](./management/spasticity.md).

**Botulinum toxin (Botox)**
Injectable medication that reduces spasticity in targeted muscles. Effects last 3-6 months. See [Spasticity Management](./management/spasticity.md).

---

## C

**CFCS (Communication Function Classification System)**
Five-level system classifying communication ability. See [CFCS](./understanding/cfcs.md).

**Contracture**
Permanent shortening of muscles or tendons that limits joint movement. Often results from prolonged spasticity.

---

## D

**Diplegia**
Cerebral palsy primarily affecting the legs more than the arms.

**Dyskinesia**
Involuntary, uncontrolled movements. See athetoid/dyskinetic cerebral palsy.

**Dysphagia**
Difficulty swallowing. Affects up to 85% of people with cerebral palsy. See [Nutrition & Feeding](./management/nutrition.md).

---

## E

**Epilepsy**
Neurological condition causing recurrent seizures. Affects approximately 50% of people with cerebral palsy. See [Epilepsy Management](./management/epilepsy.md), [Secondary Conditions](./understanding/co-occurring/secondary-conditions.md).

**Equinus**
Walking on toes due to tight calf muscles. See [Gait Patterns](./management/gait-patterns.md).

---

## F

**FEES (Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing)**
Camera-based swallowing assessment where a scope is passed through the nose. See [Nutrition & Feeding](./management/nutrition.md).

**FIM (Functional Independence Measure)**
Standardized assessment tool measuring independence in daily activities. See [Functional Independence](./assessment/functional-independence.md).

---

## G

**Gastrostomy tube (G-tube)**
Feeding tube placed directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall for long-term nutritional support. See [Nutrition & Feeding](./management/nutrition.md).



**GMFCS (Gross Motor Function Classification System)**
Five-level system classifying mobility. Level I walks without limitations; Level V transported in wheelchair. See [GMFCS](./understanding/gmfcs.md).

---

## H

**Hemiplegia**
Cerebral palsy affecting one side of the body (arm and leg on the same side).

**Hypertonia**
Increased muscle tone (stiffness). Includes spasticity.

---

## I

**ITB (Intrathecal Baclofen)**
Surgically implanted pump delivering baclofen directly to spinal fluid. See [Spasticity Management](./management/spasticity.md).

---

## M

**MACS (Manual Ability Classification System)**
Five-level system classifying hand function. See [MACS](./understanding/macs.md).

---

## N

**Neurologist**
Physician specializing in nervous system disorders. Manages seizures and some spasticity medications.

**Neuropsychologist**
Psychologist specializing in brain-behavior relationships. Conducts cognitive and autism assessments. See [Cognitive Assessment](./assessment/cognitive.md).

---

## O

**Orthosis (plural: Orthoses)**
External device supporting body structure. Includes AFOs, hand splints, trunk supports. See [Equipment & Devices](./management/equipment.md).

**Orthotist**
Specialist who designs, fabricates, and fits orthoses.

---

## P

**Physiatrist**
Physician specializing in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R). Key coordinator for cerebral palsy care. See [Physiatrist Role](./management/physiatrist-role.md).

**PM&R (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation)**
Medical specialty focused on restoring function. Physiatrists are PM&R physicians.

---

## Q

**Quadriplegia**
Cerebral palsy affecting all four limbs and usually the trunk.

---

## S

**Scoliosis**
Abnormal lateral curvature of the spine. Affects 46% of adults with cerebral palsy. See [Secondary Conditions](./understanding/co-occurring/secondary-conditions.md).

**Spasticity**
Increased muscle tone causing stiffness and resistance to movement. A core feature of spastic cerebral palsy. See [Spasticity Management](./management/spasticity.md).

**Spastic cerebral palsy**
Most common type, characterized by stiff, tight muscles.

---

## T

**THA (Total Hip Arthroplasty)**
Hip replacement surgery. Achieves 87% pain relief and 79% functional improvement in adults with cerebral palsy. See [Orthopedics & Hip](./management/orthopedics.md).

**Tizanidine**
Oral muscle relaxant used for spasticity. See [Spasticity Management](./management/spasticity.md).

**Transition**
Process of moving from pediatric to adult healthcare. See [Transition to Adult Care](./getting-started/transition.md).
