# Cerebral Palsy Knowledge Base

A guide for caretakers of adults with cerebral palsy navigating assessment, services, and care.

## What is Cerebral Palsy?

Cerebral palsy is a group of neurological disorders caused by brain injury or abnormal development before, during, or shortly after birth. It primarily affects movement and posture but often co-occurs with other conditions affecting cognition, communication, and behavior. Cerebral palsy is non-progressive—the original brain injury doesn't worsen—but its effects on the body can change over time, especially with aging. <Cite slug="doi-10-1080-17518423-2024-2347991" />

## Core Domains

### [Classification](./classification/)
How cerebral palsy is categorized by motor function, manual ability, and communication. Classification levels help match people with appropriate services and set realistic expectations.

→ GMFCS (mobility) · MACS (hand function) · CFCS (communication)

### [Assessment](./assessment/)
How adults with cerebral palsy should be evaluated. Many adults were never comprehensively assessed or were assessed only in childhood. Proper assessment identifies needs and qualifies for services.

→ NICE guidelines · Cognitive evaluation · Functional independence measures

### [Co-occurring Conditions](./co-occurring/)
Conditions that frequently appear alongside cerebral palsy. Autism occurs in 6-9% of people with cerebral palsy (5x the general population). Nearly half have scoliosis and over a quarter have epilepsy. Understanding co-occurrence prevents misdiagnosis and ensures complete care.

→ Autism co-occurrence · Secondary conditions · Classification differences

### [Management](./management/)
Treatment approaches and specialist roles. Physiatrists serve as comprehensive care coordinators for adults with cerebral palsy. Pain affects 70% of adults and requires active management. Spasticity treatment ranges from oral medications to surgical options.

→ Physiatrist role · Pain management · Spasticity · Equipment · Gait patterns

### [Adults](./adults/)
Issues specific to adults with cerebral palsy, including late diagnosis, mental health, and aging. Depression and anxiety occur at twice the rate of the general population. Many adults were diagnosed in childhood but never received adult-appropriate assessment or services.

→ Late diagnosis · Mental health · Finding services · Transition · Caregiver support
