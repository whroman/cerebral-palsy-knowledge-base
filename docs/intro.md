# Cerebral Palsy Knowledge Base

## Purpose

This knowledge base provides evidence-based information about cerebral palsy (CP) assessment and management, with a particular focus on adults. All medical claims are supported by citations from peer-reviewed sources, clinical guidelines, and official classification system documentation.

## Important Note on Sources

Every medical claim in this knowledge base is backed by legitimate sources including:
- Peer-reviewed research from PubMed
- Official classification system documentation (GMFCS, MACS, CFCS)
- Clinical guidelines from NICE and AACPDM
- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

## Scope

This resource covers:
- Modern classification systems for CP
- Assessment standards for adults with CP
- Cognitive and functional assessment tools
- Resources for adults diagnosed later in life
- Current research and evidence

## Key Statistics

According to systematic reviews:
- **Globally, there are more than 17 million individuals diagnosed with CP** [^1]
- **Approximately 30-50% of people with CP have typical intelligence** [^2]
- **Pain prevalence in adults with CP is approximately 70%** [^3]
- **On average, 40% of adults with CP are employed and 30% live independently** [^4]

## For Families

This knowledge base was created to help families understand:
- Modern assessment standards for adults with CP
- Classification systems used by healthcare providers
- Available resources and support services
- Evidence-based approaches to care
