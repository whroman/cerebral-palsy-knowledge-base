# Cerebral Palsy Knowledge Base - Table of Contents

## Purpose
Evidence-based information hub for cerebral palsy assessment, management, and co-occurring conditions. All claims are backed by peer-reviewed sources and clinical guidelines.

---

## 📚 Core Knowledge Areas

### 1. Classification Systems
**Understanding how cerebral palsy is categorized and assessed**

- **[GMFCS - Gross Motor Function](./classification/gmfcs.md)** - Five-level system for classifying gross motor abilities
- **[MACS - Manual Ability](./classification/macs.md)** - Classification of hand function and object manipulation
- **[CFCS - Communication Function](./classification/cfcs.md)** - System for classifying everyday communication effectiveness

### 2. Assessment Standards
**Comprehensive evaluation approaches for adults with cerebral palsy**

- **[Assessment Overview](./assessment/overview.md)** - NICE guidelines and systematic review findings
- **[Cognitive Assessment](./assessment/cognitive.md)** - Prevalence and evaluation of intellectual function
- **[Functional Independence](./assessment/functional-independence.md)** - FIM and other independence measures

### 3. Co-occurring Conditions
**Understanding related and overlapping conditions**

- **[Autism and Cerebral Palsy Co-occurrence](./co-occurring/autism-cp.md)** - 6-9% prevalence, screening importance, assessment adaptations
- **[Classification Differences](./co-occurring/neurological-vs-neurodevelopmental.md)** - Why cerebral palsy is neurological while autism is neurodevelopmental

### 4. Clinical Management
**Treatment approaches and specialist roles**

- **[Physiatrists as Coordinators](./management/physiatrist-role.md)** - Central role in comprehensive adult cerebral palsy care
- **[Gait Patterns and Treatment](./management/gait-patterns.md)** - Understanding and treating asymmetric walking patterns

### 5. Adults with Cerebral Palsy
**Specific considerations for adult populations**

- **[Late Diagnosis](./adults/late-diagnosis.md)** - Adults diagnosed later in life or never properly assessed

## 🔍 Quick Reference

### Key Statistics
- **17 million** people globally have cerebral palsy [^1]
- **70%** of adults with cerebral palsy experience chronic pain [^2]
- **6-9%** of people with cerebral palsy also have autism (vs 1-2% general population) [^3]
- **5-fold increased odds** of autism in people with cerebral palsy [^3]

### Critical Specialists
- **Physiatrist** - Comprehensive assessment coordinator
- **Neurologist** - Medication and seizure management
- **Neuropsychologist** - Cognitive and autism assessment
- **PT/OT/SLP** - Therapy services

### Important Classifications
- **Cerebral Palsy**: Neurological condition (ICD-11 Chapter 8)
- **Autism**: Neurodevelopmental disorder (DSM-5/ICD-11)
- Despite different classifications, high co-occurrence rate
