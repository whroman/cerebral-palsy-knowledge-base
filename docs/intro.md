## What is Cerebral Palsy?

Cerebral palsy is a group of neurological disorders caused by brain injury or abnormal development before, during, or shortly after birth. It primarily affects movement and posture but often co-occurs with other conditions affecting cognition, communication, and behavior. Cerebral palsy is non-progressive—the original brain injury doesn't worsen—but its effects on the body can change over time, especially with aging. [^1]

## Core Domains

### [Classification](./classification/)
How cerebral palsy is categorized by motor function, manual ability, and communication. Classification levels help match people with appropriate services and set realistic expectations.

→ GMFCS (mobility) · MACS (hand function) · CFCS (communication)

### [Assessment](./assessment/)
How adults with cerebral palsy should be evaluated. Many adults were never comprehensively assessed or were assessed only in childhood. Proper assessment identifies needs and qualifies for services.

→ NICE guidelines · Cognitive evaluation · Functional independence measures

### [Co-occurring Conditions](./co-occurring/)
Conditions that frequently appear alongside cerebral palsy. Autism occurs in 6-9% of people with cerebral palsy (5x the general population). Understanding co-occurrence prevents misdiagnosis and ensures complete care.

→ Autism co-occurrence · Neurological vs neurodevelopmental classification

### [Management](./management/)
Treatment approaches and specialist roles. Physiatrists serve as comprehensive care coordinators for adults with cerebral palsy. Understanding who does what prevents fragmented care.

→ Physiatrist role · Gait patterns and treatment

### [Adults](./adults/)
Issues specific to adults with cerebral palsy, including late diagnosis and aging. Many adults were diagnosed in childhood but never received adult-appropriate assessment or services.

→ Late diagnosis · Finding adult services
