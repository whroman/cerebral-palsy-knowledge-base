A guide for caretakers of adults with cerebral palsy navigating assessment, services, and care.

## What is Cerebral Palsy?

Cerebral palsy is a group of neurological disorders caused by brain injury or abnormal development before, during, or shortly after birth. It primarily affects movement and posture but often co-occurs with other conditions affecting cognition, communication, and behavior. Cerebral palsy is non-progressive—the original brain injury doesn't worsen—but its effects on the body can change over time, especially with aging. <Cite slug="doi-10-1080-17518423-2024-2347991" />

## Core Domains

### [Understanding Cerebral Palsy](./understanding/)
How cerebral palsy is categorized by motor function, manual ability, and communication. Classification levels help match people with appropriate services and set realistic expectations. Also covers co-occurring conditions like autism (6-9%, 5x general population) and secondary conditions.

→ GMFCS (mobility) · MACS (hand function) · CFCS (communication) · Co-occurring conditions

### [Assessment](./assessment/)
How adults with cerebral palsy should be evaluated. Many adults were never comprehensively assessed or were assessed only in childhood. Proper assessment identifies needs and qualifies for services.

→ NICE guidelines · Cognitive evaluation · Functional independence measures

### [Management](./management/)
Treatment approaches and specialist roles. Physiatrists serve as comprehensive care coordinators for adults with cerebral palsy. Pain affects 70% of adults and requires active management. <Cite slug="pubmed-32061920" /> Dysphagia affects up to 85% and is a leading cause of preventable mortality. <Cite slug="pubmed-39985076" />

→ Physiatrist role · Pain management · Spasticity · Nutrition & Feeding · Communication · Equipment · Gait patterns

### [Getting Started](./getting-started/finding-services.md)
Finding and accessing care for adults with cerebral palsy. Covers locating providers, transitioning from pediatric to adult care, and assessment for those diagnosed late in life.

→ Finding services · Transition to adult care · Late diagnosis

### [Living with Cerebral Palsy](./living/)
Long-term considerations for adults with cerebral palsy. Depression and anxiety occur at twice the rate of the general population. <Cite slug="pubmed-31382276" /> Over 80% live beyond age 58, with mild cases having near-normal life expectancy. <Cite slug="pmc-6549269" />

→ Mental health · Life expectancy · Caregiver support
