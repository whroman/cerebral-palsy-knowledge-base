# Functional Independence Assessment

## Functional Independence Measure (FIM)

The Functional Independence Measure is widely used in rehabilitation settings for assessing functional abilities.

### Reliability and Validity

According to research: **"The FIM has demonstrated acceptable reliability across a wide variety of settings, raters, and patients, with median interrater reliability for the total FIM of 0.95 and median test-retest and equivalence reliability values of 0.95 and 0.92, respectively."** [^1]

**"The median reliability values for the six FIM subscales ranged from 0.95 for Self-Care to 0.78 for Social Cognition, and for individual FIM items, median reliability values varied from 0.90 for Toilet Transfer to 0.61 for Comprehension."** [^1]

### Validity Evidence

**"Content validity was established through a pilot study done at 11 centers with 110 patients evaluated. The concurrent validity with Barthel Index (ICC > 0.83) has shown strong construct validity between items on Barthel Index and items on the FIM."** [^2]

**"The FIM has consistently demonstrated good interrater reliability and validity, and is an excellent tool for detecting changes during rehabilitation; however, there is a ceiling effect that limits its utility for long-term follow-up."** [^2]

### Use in Neurological Populations

While specific CP studies are limited, evidence from neurological populations shows: **"A study of Greek patients with neurological disorders found that the FIM is a valid and reliable instrument for examining patients' functional independence in daily activities, providing reliability and validity evidence in a sample of patients with neurological disorders including stroke (N=50) and traumatic brain injury (N=24)."** [^3]

### Motor vs. Cognitive Subscales

**"Median and mean reliability coefficients for FIM motor items were generally higher than for items in the cognitive or communication subscales. The FIM showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.98 for total FIM, 0.95 and 0.89 for FIM Motor and FIM Cognitive, respectively)."** [^1]

### Limitations

**"Results may not be valid for patient populations with cognitive or communication deficits, though a modest agreement between patient self-reporting and multidisciplinary assessment of FIM motor score was demonstrated."** [^4]

**"The FIM does not contain key activity or participation elements of patient recovery important for measuring outcome and burden of illness (e.g., return to work, relationships, social and recreational pastimes)."** [^2]
