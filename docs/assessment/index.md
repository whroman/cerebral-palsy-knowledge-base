# Assessment

Many adults with cerebral palsy were never comprehensively assessed, or were assessed only in childhood. Adult assessment identifies current needs, qualifies for services, and guides treatment planning.

## Why Assessment Matters

Proper assessment:
- Documents functional abilities for service eligibility
- Identifies co-occurring conditions (autism, cognitive differences)
- Establishes baselines for tracking changes with aging
- Guides referrals to appropriate specialists

## Key Assessment Areas

| Area | What's Assessed | Who Assesses |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Motor function** | Walking, transfers, mobility | Physiatrist, PT |
| **Cognition** | Memory, processing, executive function | Neuropsychologist |
| **Communication** | Speech, AAC needs | SLP |
| **Pain** | Chronic pain (70% of adults affected) | Physiatrist, PCP |
| **Mental health** | Depression, anxiety | Psychiatrist, psychologist |
| **Independence** | Daily living activities | OT |

## The Assessment Gap

Adults with cerebral palsy commonly experience:
- **No adult assessment** - childhood records only
- **Incomplete assessment** - motor focus, cognition ignored
- **Outdated assessment** - needs change with aging
- **Fragmented assessment** - multiple providers, no coordination

## What to Request

1. **Comprehensive physiatry evaluation** - coordinates overall assessment
2. **Neuropsychological testing** - if cognitive concerns or autism suspected
3. **Functional independence assessment** - documents daily living abilities
4. **Pain screening** - routine, given 70% prevalence

## NICE Guidelines

UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends adults with cerebral palsy receive:
- Assessment by specialist multidisciplinary team
- Evaluation of vocational and independent living skills
- Care and support needs assessment
- Mental health screening alongside physical health
