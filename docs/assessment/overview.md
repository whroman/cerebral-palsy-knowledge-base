# Assessment Standards for Adults with Cerebral Palsy

## NICE Guidelines for Adult Assessment

The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) provides comprehensive guidelines for assessing adults with cerebral palsy.

### Key Assessment Areas

According to NICE guideline NG119: [^1]

**"Adults with cerebral palsy should be given information about assessments of vocational and independent living skills that is tailored to the person's functional abilities and goals."** [^1]

### Bone and Joint Assessment

**"NICE recommends considering assessment for risk of fractures secondary to osteoporosis in adults with cerebral palsy, with risk factors including needing help with moving or having to be moved."** [^1]

**"A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) assessment should be considered in adults with cerebral palsy who have 2 or more risk factors, particularly if they have had a previous low-impact fracture."** [^1]

### Communication Assessment

**"Adults with cerebral palsy who have communication difficulties should be referred to speech and language therapy services to assess their need for intervention, which may include use of alternative or augmentative communication systems or intensive speech therapy."** [^2]

### Mental Health Assessment

**"Mental health problems should be identified and addressed alongside physical health problems."** [^1]

### Care and Support Needs

**"Adults with cerebral palsy and their families should be explained their right to a care and support needs assessment, in line with the Care Act 2014."** [^1]

### Specialist Multidisciplinary Team

**"Service providers should ensure they have a specialist multidisciplinary team with expertise in neurodisabilities, with systems in place to assess the needs of adults with cerebral palsy and their ability to carry out daily activities."** [^1]

## Recent Systematic Reviews

### Pain Assessment

A 2020 systematic review found: **"A meta-analysis revealed a high pain prevalence of 70% in adults with CP, suggesting that adults with CP should be routinely screened for pain."** [^3]

### Health Service Use

A 2021 mixed-methods systematic review examined: **"Health service use among adults with cerebral palsy, aiming to determine the proportion of adults with CP using health services and their frequency of use, as well as exploring experiences and perceptions of health services."** [^4]

### Epidemiology of Adult Outcomes

A 2020 systematic review found: **"On average, adults with CP experience fatigue, a majority experience pain and are ambulant, with 40% employed and 30% living independently."** [^5]
