# Cognitive and Intellectual Assessment in Adults with Cerebral Palsy

## Prevalence of Cognitive Involvement

Research shows significant variability in cognitive function among people with cerebral palsy:

- **"Globally, there are more than 17 million individuals diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and one-fourth of cerebral palsy patients will never be able to walk and 50% of them with severe intellectual disability will become adults."** <Cite slug="doi-10-1080-17518423-2024-2347991" />
- **"Up to 50% of individuals with cerebral palsy also experience intellectual impairments."** <Cite slug="ncbi-nbk538147" />

## Distribution of Cognitive Abilities

A study of cognitive functioning found: **"36.2% had normal/borderline intellectual development levels, 33% had mild/moderate intellectual disability, and 30.8% had severe intellectual disability,"** demonstrating the full spectrum of cognitive abilities in this population. <Cite slug="pmc-5439469" />

## Important Understanding

A comprehensive review found: **"There is large variability in the type and severity of cognitive impairments among individuals with cerebral palsy, ranging from challenges affecting functioning in just one area to severe and global impairments. Although cognition and motor functioning are associated, there is not a one-to-one relationship."** <Cite slug="pmc-12470702" />

This means:
- About half of individuals with cerebral palsy have no significant cognitive impairment
- Motor severity does not predict cognitive ability
- Each person requires individual cognitive assessment

## Assessment Challenges in Adults

A 2024 scoping review found: **"The included studies show great variability in reported intelligence and cognitive functioning in adults with cerebral palsy, and cognitive deficits have been reported in all cognitive domains."** <Cite slug="pubmed-38702978" />

**"For individuals with cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments may become more pronounced as the demands of life increase. For individuals with cerebral palsy, there is no one-to-one correlation between cognition and functioning in other areas, and therefore, cognition must be individually assessed to determine what targeted interventions are needed."** <Cite slug="pubmed-38702978" />

## Study Findings in Adults

A study of adult cerebral palsy patients found: **"A total of 70 adult cerebral palsy patients (37 males, 33 females; mean age 29.4±10.2 years; range, 19 to 68 years) who were admitted to clinic"** were evaluated, and **"Half of our patients had poor mental state."** <Cite slug="pmc-7756828" />

Another finding: **"Intellectual disability was diagnosed in 22.0%, similar to other studies where participants had a cognitive assessment, but lower than in studies where intellectual disability is registered not by psychologists, but by other professions"** <Cite slug="pubmed-38702978" />

## Age-Related Considerations

**"Because children with cerebral palsy are often told that it is a non-progressive disease, they may be unprepared for the greater effects of the aging process as they head into their 30s. Young adults with cerebral palsy experience problems with aging that non-disabled adults experience 'much later in life'."** <Cite slug="pmc-7756828" />

## Need for Systematic Monitoring

According to research published in Frontiers in Neurology: **"Systematic Monitoring of Cognition for Adults With Cerebral Palsy—The Rationale Behind the Development of the CPCog-Adult Follow-Up Protocol"** emphasizes the importance of regular cognitive assessment in adults with cerebral palsy. <Cite slug="pmc-8492925" />
