# Healthcare Transition

The shift from pediatric to adult healthcare is one of the most challenging periods for people with cerebral palsy. Many experience a sudden loss of coordinated care, leaving them to navigate an unfamiliar system alone.

## The Transition Gap

No standardized transition tool or approach exists across programs. <Cite slug="pubmed-37552305" />

This lack of structure leads to poor outcomes including: <Cite slug="pubmed-37552305" />
- Housing instability
- Unemployment
- Difficulty forming relationships
- Increased hospital admission rates
- Decreased use of rehabilitation services

## Systemic Barriers

Adults with cerebral palsy face significant obstacles in accessing appropriate care: <Cite slug="pubmed-37552305" />

**Provider availability**
- Limited adult providers accept patients with cerebral palsy
- Adult physicians often lack training in cerebral palsy management
- Specialists familiar with childhood cerebral palsy may not see adults

**System gaps**
- Poor communication within health service teams
- Lack of financial resources for specialized care
- No designated "medical home" for ongoing coordination

**Knowledge gaps**
- Adult healthcare providers unfamiliar with cerebral palsy <Cite slug="pmc-5073482" />
- Patients encounter physicians lacking cerebral palsy expertise <Cite slug="pubmed-26754030" />

## Patient Experience

Young adults with cerebral palsy often feel unprepared and abandoned by the healthcare system. <Cite slug="pubmed-26754030" />

Common experiences during transition: <Cite slug="pubmed-37552305" />
- Lack of transition preparedness
- Difficulty navigating the adult system
- Gaps in seamless care
- Limited accessibility to specialists

> Young adults "felt that they had been abandoned by the healthcare system and lacked a medical home."

## What Helps

Research identifies protective factors that improve transition outcomes: <Cite slug="pubmed-37552305" />

### Family Involvement
Continued family support during and after transition provides stability and advocacy.

### Self-Efficacy Promotion
Building independence and self-management skills before transition prepares young adults to navigate adult systems.

### Early Introduction to Adult Care
Meeting adult care teams before the formal transition creates familiarity and reduces anxiety.

### Body Awareness
Developing awareness of one's own body and how to manage symptoms is critical for self-advocacy in adult healthcare. <Cite slug="pubmed-23614354" />

## Preparing for Transition

### Before Age 18

- Begin discussing transition early in adolescence
- Identify adult providers who accept cerebral palsy patients
- Build self-advocacy skills
- Learn to describe your condition and needs
- Develop body awareness and symptom management strategies <Cite slug="pubmed-23614354" />
- Create a portable medical summary

### During Transition

- Request a formal transition meeting with pediatric and adult providers
- Ensure medical records transfer completely
- Identify a primary care physician as your "medical home"
- Connect with adult rehabilitation services
- Build a new care team before losing pediatric coverage

### After Transition

- Establish regular check-ups with adult providers
- Maintain relationships with specialists (physiatry, neurology, orthopedics)
- Monitor for functional changes common in adulthood
- Stay connected to cerebral palsy community resources

## Finding Adult Providers

Adult cerebral palsy care is often fragmented. Consider:

**Physiatrists (PM&R physicians)**
Many specialize in adult cerebral palsy and can coordinate care across specialists.

**Academic medical centers**
University hospitals often have lifespan programs or adult cerebral palsy clinics.

**Cerebral palsy organizations**
The [Cerebral Palsy Research Network](https://cprn.org) and similar organizations maintain provider directories.

## Key Points

- No standardized transition approach exists—preparation is essential
- Limited adult providers accept cerebral palsy patients
- Family involvement and self-efficacy are protective factors
- Early introduction to adult care teams improves outcomes
- A primary care "medical home" helps coordinate ongoing care
