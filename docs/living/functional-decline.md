# Functional Decline in Adults with Cerebral Palsy

Although the brain injury that causes cerebral palsy does not worsen over time, adults commonly experience progressive decline in physical function. This is not inevitable—understanding the patterns and causes allows for prevention and intervention.

## How Common Is Decline?

Functional decline affects the majority of adults with cerebral palsy: <Cite slug="pubmed-38433033" />

- **60%** report decline in gross motor function since childhood <Cite slug="pubmed-38433033" />
- **25%** or more of ambulant adults experience gait decline <Cite slug="pubmed-37552305" />
- **40%** of adults who walked in adolescence lost this ability over two decades <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />
- **50%** report decreased daily functional activities by the fourth decade <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />

Decline increases with age across all domains. <Cite slug="pubmed-38433033" />

## Timeline of Changes

### Late 20s to Early 30s
Most noticeable decrements in strength and functional reserve begin appearing. <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />

### Age 35+
Ambulatory function typically begins declining. <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />

### 10-14 Year Follow-Up Data

In a longitudinal study of adults aged 35-45: <Cite slug="pubmed-28427924" />

| Measure | Baseline | Follow-up |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Worried about health | 29% | 54% | <Cite slug="pubmed-28427924" />
| Health limits activities | 19% | 45% | <Cite slug="pubmed-28427924" />
| Indoor walking ability | 83% | 71% | <Cite slug="pubmed-28427924" />

## What Causes Decline?

Functional decline results from multiple interacting factors: <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />

### Musculoskeletal Changes
- **Sarcopenia** (muscle loss) occurs earlier than in the general population
- Osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency (>50% of adults) <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />
- Increased risk of fragility fractures
- Progressive joint contractures and deformities

### Chronic Pain and Fatigue
- **75%** experience persistent chronic pain <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />
- **32%** report severe fatigue <Cite slug="pubmed-28427924" />
- Pain and fatigue directly contribute to reduced activity

### Cardiometabolic Conditions
Adults with cerebral palsy have higher rates of: <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Cardiovascular disease
- Metabolic syndrome (20-29% prevalence) <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />

### Swallowing Dysfunction
Gradual deterioration in swallowing begins as early as age 30, with increased aspiration risks despite maintained dietary patterns. <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />

## Risk Factors for Greater Decline

Higher risk of functional decline occurs in those who: <Cite slug="pubmed-37552305" />
- Are older
- Have less independent gait
- Have bilateral motor impairment
- Experience higher levels of pain
- Have higher GMFCS levels

## Prevention and Intervention

### Regular Monitoring

> "Systematic follow-up of adults with cerebral palsy appears necessary" <Cite slug="pubmed-28427924" />

Annual or regular assessments should track:
- Gross motor function changes
- Pain levels
- Fatigue
- Walking ability
- Strength

### Physical Activity

Maintaining physical activity helps preserve function. Exercise programs should be:
- Adapted to current abilities
- Sustainable long-term
- Focused on strength and endurance

### Pain Management

Addressing chronic pain reduces its impact on function and activity levels. Options include:
- Medication management
- Physical therapy
- Botulinum toxin injections
- Intrathecal baclofen for spasticity <Cite slug="cprn-functional-decline" />

### Nutrition and Bone Health

- Screen for vitamin D deficiency
- Address calcium intake
- Monitor bone density
- Prevent malnutrition

### Assistive Technology

Timely introduction of mobility aids and assistive devices can preserve participation even as function changes.

## What To Expect

Functional decline does not mean loss of quality of life. With appropriate support: <Cite slug="pmc-5073482" />

- Adaptation strategies maintain participation
- Assistive technology compensates for physical changes
- Self-awareness helps manage symptoms
- Planning ahead reduces crisis situations

Adults aging with cerebral palsy describe developing acceptance of change while taking charge of the help they need. <Cite slug="pmc-5073482" />

## When to Seek Help

Contact your healthcare provider if you notice:
- New difficulty with activities you could previously do
- Increased pain or fatigue
- Changes in walking pattern or endurance
- Swallowing difficulties
- Falls or near-falls

Early intervention can slow or reverse some aspects of decline.

## Key Points

- 60% of adults with cerebral palsy report gross motor decline since childhood <Cite slug="pubmed-38433033" />
- Decline is not from worsening brain injury—it's from secondary changes
- Major contributors: pain, fatigue, sarcopenia, inactivity
- Decline accelerates after age 35 but signs appear in late 20s <Cite slug="pmc-6637058" />
- Regular monitoring and early intervention can preserve function
- Assistive technology and adaptation maintain quality of life
