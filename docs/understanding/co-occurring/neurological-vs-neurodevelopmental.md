# Neurological vs Neurodevelopmental: Understanding Cerebral Palsy and Autism Classification

## Different Classification "Parents"

Despite their high co-occurrence rate, cerebral palsy and autism spectrum disorder are classified in entirely different categories within medical classification systems.

## Cerebral Palsy Classification

### ICD-11 Classification

In ICD-11, cerebral palsy is classified under **Chapter 8 - "Diseases of the nervous system"** <Cite slug="who-icd11-cp" />

The ICD-11 cerebral palsy codes include:
- 8D20: Spastic cerebral palsy
- 8D21: Dyskinetic cerebral palsy
- 8D22: Ataxic cerebral palsy
- 8D23: Worster-Drought syndrome
- 8D2Y: Other specified cerebral palsy
- 8D2Z: Cerebral palsy, unspecified <Cite slug="who-icd11-cp" />

### Neurological Classification Rationale

**"Cerebral palsy is described as a heterogeneous group of motor disorders"** and **"a group of neurological disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body movement and muscle coordination"** <Cite slug="pmc-7297454" />

Cerebral palsy is characterized as **"a motor disorder resulting from brain injury or abnormalities affecting the motor areas of the brain"** <Cite slug="pmc-7297454" />

## Autism Spectrum Disorder Classification

### DSM-5 Classification

**"The DSM-5 includes autism spectrum disorder within a chapter entitled 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders'"** <Cite slug="pubmed-27364515" />

**"The APA believes the new name reflects the scientific consensus that four previously separate disorders are actually a single condition with different levels of symptom severity in two core domains"** <Cite slug="pubmed-27364515" />

### ICD-11 Classification

**"The ICD-11 endorses a medical model, conceptualising Autism Spectrum Disorder as a medical condition with an inborn, for a substantial part, genetically inherited nature, while acknowledging that gene-environment interactions also play a pivotal role in neurodevelopment (classifying this category in the over-arching category of Neurodevelopmental Disorders)"** <Cite slug="pmc-9881114" />

## Key Differences in Classification

### Neurodevelopmental Disorders Category

**"The term 'neurodevelopmental disorders' was first used in DSM-5. The ICD-11 retained this term, with some changes in the classification compared to DSM-5 and ICD-10"** <Cite slug="pmc-10411432" />

The neurodevelopmental disorders category in both systems includes: <Cite slug="pmc-10411432" />
- Intellectual disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)
- Communication disorders
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
- Specific learning disorder
- Motor disorders

### Why Cerebral Palsy Is Not Classified as Neurodevelopmental

Despite affecting development, cerebral palsy is classified as a neurological rather than neurodevelopmental condition because:
1. It results from a specific brain injury or abnormality
2. It primarily affects motor function
3. It is non-progressive (doesn't worsen over time)
4. The brain injury occurs at a specific point in time

## Brain Regions and Functions Affected

### Cerebral Palsy

**"Most children with cerebral palsy have an abnormal brain MRI scan, including white matter damage, basal ganglia or deep grey matter damage, congenital malformation and focal infarcts"** <Cite slug="pmc-11015243" />

Cerebral palsy primarily affects motor areas of the brain, while autism involves differences in social brain networks, language processing areas, and behavior regulation centers.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism involves differences in:
- Social brain networks
- Language processing areas
- Behavior regulation centers
- Neural connectivity patterns

## The Co-occurrence Paradox

### High Co-occurrence Despite Different Classifications

**"Among children with NDDs, 21.7% had two or more; comorbid NDDs were most common in children with ASD (79.6%), cerebral palsy (74.2%), ID (56.9%) and epilepsy (55.1%)"** <Cite slug="capmh-2022-00462" />

This suggests that despite being classified differently:
- These conditions share overlapping risk factors
- Early brain development disruption can affect multiple systems
- The traditional classification boundaries may be somewhat artificial

### Shared Risk Factors

The significant association between cerebral palsy and autism is not surprising, as both conditions result from early brain development disturbances. Common risk factors include: <Cite slug="pmc-11015243" />

- **Prematurity**: The most prevalent risk factor for cerebral palsy, also associated with heightened ASD risk
- **Maternal infection during pregnancy**: Connected to both conditions
- **Perinatal hypoxia**: Linked to cerebral palsy and heightened ASD vulnerability
- **Low Apgar scores at birth**: Associated with increased risk of both conditions
- **Fetal growth restriction**
- **Brain malformations**

While cerebral palsy and autism share these risk factors, one does not directly cause the other. They may co-occur due to overlapping factors affecting early brain development. <Cite slug="pmc-11015243" />

## Clinical Implications of Classification Differences

### Treatment Approaches

**"Cerebral palsy, ASD and ADHD are usually diagnosed in different clinical specialties, with different intervention approaches"** <Cite slug="pmc-11015243" />

This classification difference leads to:
- Cerebral palsy typically managed by neurologists and physiatrists
- Autism typically managed by developmental pediatricians and psychiatrists
- Potential for fragmented care when both conditions are present
- Need for interdisciplinary coordination

### Assessment Challenges

The different classifications can create challenges:
- Assessment tools designed for one condition may miss the other
- Specialists may not screen for co-occurring conditions outside their domain
- Insurance coverage may differ based on classification

## Future Directions

### Evolving Understanding

**"Some neurodevelopmental disorders in early life can be temporary, whereas progressive motor disorders, at least in the first period of disease, can have a similar clinical presentation to that of cerebral palsy"** <Cite slug="pmc-7297454" />

This highlights:
- The complexity of classification
- Ongoing evolution in understanding these conditions
- Potential for future reclassification as knowledge advances

## Key Takeaway

While cerebral palsy (neurological) and autism (neurodevelopmental) are classified in different medical categories, their frequent co-occurrence suggests that rigid classification boundaries may not fully capture the complex reality of early brain development disruption. Understanding both classification systems is essential for comprehensive care.
