# Autism Spectrum Disorder and Cerebral Palsy Co-occurrence

## Overview

Research consistently demonstrates that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occurs at significantly higher rates in people with cerebral palsy compared to the general population. This co-occurrence has important implications for assessment and treatment.

## Prevalence Data

### Key Statistics

According to multiple systematic studies:

- **"Children with cerebral palsy had a significantly higher prevalence of ASD (6.09%) compared to children without cerebral palsy (1.15%)"** <Cite slug="pmc-11015243" />
- **"Among children with cerebral palsy, 107 had an associated diagnosis of ASD - i.e., 8.7% of the study population (95% confidence interval 7.2-10.5). Variations between geographical areas ranged from 4.0% to 16.7%"** <Cite slug="pubmed-28439889" />
- **"The US Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network 2008 reported that co-occurring ASD frequency was 6.9% among 8-year-old children with cerebral palsy"** <Cite slug="pmc-4351771" />

### Statistical Associations

**"After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, family highest education level, family income level and geographical region, the OR among children with cerebral palsy, compared with children without cerebral palsy, was 5.07 (95% CI 3.25 to 7.91) for ASD (p\<0.001)"** <Cite slug="pmc-11015243" />

This represents a **5-fold increased odds** of having autism among children with cerebral palsy.

## Under-diagnosis Problem

### Screening vs Clinical Diagnosis

**"One third (74/213) of children screened positive for ASD and half of the children (106/213) for ADHD, which was about twice as often as ASD/ADHD diagnoses had been clinically identified"** <Cite slug="pmc-7595991" />

This suggests significant under-diagnosis of autism in children with cerebral palsy.

## Associated Factors

### Characteristics of Cerebral Palsy-ASD Co-occurrence

According to research, factors associated with ASD in cerebral palsy include:
- Male sex predominance
- Co-occurring epilepsy
- Intellectual disability
- **Less severe motor impairment** (better walking ability) <Cite slug="pubmed-28439889" />

**"Children with intellectual disability, epilepsy and/or impaired speech ability more often screened positive for ASD as well as ADHD. Severe motor impairment was more frequently associated with screen-positive ASD"** <Cite slug="pmc-7595991" />

## Assessment Challenges

### Standard Tools Limitations

**"The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised (M-CHAT-R), a common screening measure for ASD, showed that only 8% of early preterm children who screened positive were actually diagnosed with ASD at 11 years of age"** <Cite slug="nature-s41390-024-03575" />

**"The administration manual for the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2), widely considered the gold standard diagnostic assessment for ASD, states that it is not designed for use with children who have significant motor impairments"** <Cite slug="nature-s41390-024-03575" />

## Multidisciplinary Assessment Requirements

### Team Composition

According to research, comprehensive evaluation requires **"a multidisciplinary approach with a team of professionals comprising of a pediatrician or pediatric neurologist, occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, child psychologist, and a social worker."** <Cite slug="pubmed-15280612" />

**"Collaboration among healthcare professionals, including neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, therapists, psychologists, and educators, is essential for comprehensive cerebral palsy assessments. A multidisciplinary approach ensures that assessments encompass all relevant domains, including motor function, communication, cognition, and psychosocial well-being."** <Cite slug="pmc-10685081" />

### Assessment Considerations

For children with motor impairments, standard autism screening tools may need adaptation. Assessment should account for physical limitations that may prevent completion of certain test items in the usual way.

## Clinical Implications

### Why Assessment Matters

**"Cerebral palsy, ASD and ADHD are usually diagnosed in different clinical specialties, with different intervention approaches"** <Cite slug="pmc-11015243" />

**"Children and young adults with co-occurring cerebral palsy and ASD have higher prevalence of clinical and functional impairments compared with counterparts with cerebral palsy without co-occurring ASD"** <Cite slug="tandfonline-17518423-2021" />

## Shared Risk Factors

### Neurological Basis

The significant association between cerebral palsy and ASD is not surprising, as both conditions result from early brain development disturbances. Research identifies several shared risk factors: <Cite slug="pmc-11015243" />

- **Prematurity**: The most prevalent risk factor for cerebral palsy, also associated with heightened ASD risk
- **Maternal infection during pregnancy**: Connected to both cerebral palsy and elevated ASD risk
- **Maternal obesity**: Significantly increases risk for both conditions
- **Perinatal hypoxia**: Linked to cerebral palsy and heightened ASD vulnerability
- **Low Apgar scores at birth**: Associated with increased risk of both conditions

Cerebral palsy represents **"an early-life sign for children at risk"** of developing ASD or ADHD, supporting the need for interdisciplinary screening and care. <Cite slug="pmc-11015243" />
