# Secondary Conditions in Adults with Cerebral Palsy

Adults with cerebral palsy experience higher rates of many chronic health conditions compared to the general population. These secondary conditions require monitoring and management throughout life.

## Overview

A systematic review of 69 studies across 18 countries found: **"Adults with cerebral palsy are more likely to have chronic conditions than the general population and are more likely to develop chronic conditions."** <Cite slug="pubmed-36807150" />

## Prevalence of Common Conditions

| Condition | Prevalence | Comparison to General Population |
|-----------|------------|----------------------------------|
| **Scoliosis** | 46% | Highly elevated |
| **Malnutrition** | 38% | Significantly elevated |
| **Urinary incontinence** | 32% | Elevated |
| **Epilepsy** | 28% | Highly elevated |
| **Hypertension** | 26% | Elevated |
| **Asthma** | 24% | Elevated |
| **Mood disorders** | 23% | Elevated |
| **Depression** | 21% | 2x general population |
| **Anxiety** | 21% | 2x general population |

<Cite slug="pubmed-36807150" />

## Musculoskeletal Conditions

### Scoliosis (46%)

The most prevalent secondary condition. Risk factors:
- Higher GMFCS levels (limited mobility)
- Asymmetric muscle tone
- Poor trunk control

Management:
- Regular spinal monitoring
- Seating and positioning interventions
- Bracing when appropriate
- Surgical consideration for severe cases

### Osteoporosis

Adults with cerebral palsy have elevated osteoporosis risk due to:
- Limited weight-bearing activity
- Anticonvulsant medications
- Vitamin D deficiency (less sun exposure)
- Lower muscle mass

Prevention:
- Weight-bearing activity when possible
- Calcium and vitamin D supplementation
- Bone density screening
- Fall prevention

## Neurological Conditions

### Epilepsy (28%)

Nearly 1 in 3 adults with cerebral palsy has epilepsy. <Cite slug="pubmed-36807150" />

- More common with dyskinetic and quadriplegic types
- Requires ongoing medication management
- Interacts with spasticity medications
- May affect cognitive function

## Gastrointestinal Conditions

### Dysphagia (Swallowing Disorders)

Common in adults with cerebral palsy, especially those with:
- Dyskinetic cerebral palsy
- Bulbar involvement
- Communication difficulties

Consequences:
- Aspiration pneumonia risk
- Malnutrition
- Dehydration

Management:
- Speech-language pathology evaluation
- Modified diet textures
- Positioning during meals
- Feeding tube consideration for severe cases

### Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD)

Associated with:
- Positioning difficulties
- Muscle tone abnormalities
- Certain medications

### Malnutrition (38%)

Causes:
- Swallowing difficulties
- Increased caloric needs (spasticity, involuntary movements)
- Feeding challenges
- Gastrointestinal issues

## Respiratory Conditions

### Asthma (24%)

Elevated rates possibly related to:
- Aspiration history
- Reduced lung capacity
- Limited exercise tolerance

### Aspiration Pneumonia

Risk factors:
- Swallowing disorders
- GERD
- Reduced cough effectiveness
- Scoliosis affecting lung function

## Cardiovascular Conditions

Adults with cerebral palsy have elevated risk for:
- Hypertension (26%) <Cite slug="pubmed-36807150" />
- Heart disease
- Stroke

Contributing factors:
- Reduced physical activity
- Obesity (in some)
- Chronic inflammation

## Urological Conditions

### Urinary Incontinence (32%)

Causes:
- Neurogenic bladder
- Limited mobility to reach bathroom
- Difficulty with clothing management
- Spasticity affecting bladder control

Management:
- Urological evaluation
- Bladder training
- Medications
- Catheterization if needed
- Adaptive equipment

## Metabolic Conditions

### Type 2 Diabetes

Elevated risk due to:
- Reduced physical activity
- Altered body composition
- Metabolic differences

### Obesity/Underweight

Both extremes occur:
- **Underweight** - feeding difficulties, high caloric needs
- **Overweight** - limited mobility, reduced activity

## Screening Recommendations

Given elevated risks, adults with cerebral palsy should receive regular screening for:

| Condition | Screening |
|-----------|-----------|
| Osteoporosis | DEXA scan earlier than general population |
| Scoliosis | Spinal examination annually |
| Hypertension | Blood pressure at every visit |
| Diabetes | Glucose/A1C every 1-3 years |
| Dysphagia | Swallowing evaluation if any symptoms |
| Depression/Anxiety | PHQ-9/GAD-7 annually |
| Nutritional status | Weight, BMI, albumin regularly |

## Key Points

- Almost half of adults with cerebral palsy have scoliosis <Cite slug="pubmed-36807150" />
- Epilepsy affects 28%—nearly 1 in 3 <Cite slug="pubmed-36807150" />
- Mental health conditions affect over 20% <Cite slug="pubmed-31382276" />
- Multiple conditions often co-occur
- Proactive screening can catch problems early
- Many secondary conditions are preventable or treatable
- A coordinated care team is essential for monitoring multiple systems
