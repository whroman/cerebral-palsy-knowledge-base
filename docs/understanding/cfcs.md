# Communication Function Classification System (CFCS)

## Official Source

The official CFCS website is available at [http://cfcs.us](http://cfcs.us), which includes additional resources and frequently asked questions.

## Overview

According to the developers: **"The Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) was created and validated for children with cerebral palsy that can be used by a wide variety of individuals who are interested in cerebral palsy."** <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />

The CFCS classifies everyday communication performance into one of five levels according to effectiveness of communication. <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />

## Development and Validation

According to the original research publication: **"An 11-member development team created comprehensive descriptions of the CFCS levels, and four nominal groups comprising 27 participants critiqued these levels. Within a Delphi survey, 112 participants commented on the clarity and usefulness of the CFCS. Interrater reliability was completed by 61 professionals and 68 parents/relatives who classified 69 children with cerebral palsy aged 2 to 18 years."** <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />

**"The CFCS demonstrates content validity and shows very good test-retest reliability, good professional interrater reliability, and moderate parent-professional interrater reliability."** <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />

## Key Features

The CFCS provides 5 levels (CFCS I, II, III, IV, V) to describe everyday communication performance. <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />

The CFCS is a valid measure that assesses everyday communication (not optimal communication). It was designed to be analogous and complementary to the GMFCS and MACS. <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />

## The Five CFCS Levels

According to the published research: <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />
- **Level I**: Child with cerebral palsy is an effective sender and receiver with unfamiliar and familiar partners
- **Level II**: Child with cerebral palsy is an effective but slower paced sender and/or receiver with unfamiliar and familiar partners
- **Level III**: Child with cerebral palsy is an effective sender and receiver with familiar partners
- **Level IV**: Child with cerebral palsy is sometimes an effective sender and receiver with familiar partners
- **Level V**: Child with cerebral palsy is seldom an effective sender and receiver even with familiar partners

## Communication Methods

Being an effective communicator requires both sending and receiving information, and the CFCS accordingly assesses both how information is expressed and how it is received. The CFCS allows all methods of communication (e.g., vocalizations, manual signs, eye gaze, pictures, communication boards, speech generating devices) to be included when assessing an individual's classification. <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />

In this way, the CFCS is inclusive and descriptive for individuals who do not vocalize to communicate. <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />

## Integration with Other Classification Systems

According to research: **"Combining the CFCS with the Gross Motor Function Classification System and the Manual Ability Classification System contributes to a functional performance view of daily life for individuals with cerebral palsy, in accordance with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health."** <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />

The CFCS is analogous and complementary to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS-ER), the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS), and the Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS). <Cite slug="pubmed-21707596" />

## Development Team and Support

Reference for the initial CFCS Development: Hidecker, M.J.C., Paneth, N., Rosenbaum, P.L., Kent, R.D., Lillie, J., Eulenberg, J.B., Chester, K., Johnson, B., Michalsen, L., Evatt, M., & Taylor, K. <Cite slug="cfcs-official" />

CFCS is a tool developed with support from the National Institute of Health (NIH), the Cerebral Palsy International Research Foundation, and The Hearst Foundation. <Cite slug="cfcs-official" />
