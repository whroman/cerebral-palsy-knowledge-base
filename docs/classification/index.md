# Classification Systems

Cerebral palsy is classified using standardized systems that describe functional abilities, not just diagnosis. These classifications help match people with appropriate services, set expectations, and communicate needs across providers.

## Why Classification Matters

Classification levels:
- Qualify individuals for specific services and supports
- Help providers understand functional needs quickly
- Enable research comparisons across populations
- Guide treatment planning and goal-setting

## The Three Core Systems

| System | Measures | Levels | Age Range |
|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **[GMFCS](./gmfcs.md)** | Gross motor function (sitting, walking, mobility) | I-V | 0-18 years |
| **[MACS](./macs.md)** | Manual ability (handling objects with hands) | I-V | 4-18 years |
| **[CFCS](./cfcs.md)** | Communication effectiveness (sending/receiving) | I-V | 2-18 years |

**Level I** = most independent function; **Level V** = most significant limitations

## Using Classifications Together

These systems are designed to be complementary. A person might be:
- GMFCS Level III (walks with assistive device)
- MACS Level I (handles objects easily)
- CFCS Level II (effective but slower communicator)

This combination gives a more complete picture than any single classification.

## Adults and Classification

These systems were developed for children but remain relevant for adults:
- Classifications are generally stable after age 6-12
- Adult services often reference childhood classification levels
- Some adults were never formally classified and may benefit from assessment

## What to Do

1. **Know your classification levels** - Request copies of assessments
2. **Understand what each level means** - Read the detailed pages below
3. **Use classifications in care planning** - Share with new providers
4. **Request reassessment if needed** - Especially if never formally classified
