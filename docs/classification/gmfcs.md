# Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS - E&R)

## Official Source

The GMFCS - E&R is developed and maintained by [CanChild at McMaster University](https://canchild.ca/resources/42-gmfcs-e-r/).

## Overview

According to CanChild, **"The Gross Motor Function Classification System - Expanded & Revised (GMFCS - E&R) is a 5-level classification system that describes the gross motor function of children and youth with cerebral palsy on the basis of their self-initiated movement with particular emphasis on sitting, walking, and wheeled mobility."** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

## Key Features

### Five Functional Levels

As documented by CanChild: **"Distinctions between levels are based on functional abilities, the need for assistive technology, including hand-held mobility devices (walkers, crutches, or canes) or wheeled mobility, and to a much lesser extent, quality of movement."** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

- **Level I**: Children can generally walk without restrictions but tend to be limited in some of the more advanced motor skills
- **Level V**: Generally very limited in their ability to move themselves around even with the use of assistive technology

### Age Bands

The GMFCS - E&R contains **5 age bands**: <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />
- Under 2 years
- 2-4 years
- 4-6 years
- 6-12 years
- 12-18 years

**"The GMFCS - E&R includes an age band for youth 12 to 18 years of age and emphasizes the concepts inherent in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)."** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

## Clinical Application

### Focus of Assessment

According to CanChild: **"The focus of the GMFCS - E&R is on determining which level best represents the child's or youth's present abilities and limitations in gross motor function. Emphasis is on usual performance in home, school, and community settings (i.e., what they do), rather than what they are known to be able to do at their best (capability)."** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

### Who Can Use It

**"Physical therapists, occupational therapists, physicians, and other health service providers familiar with movement abilities of children with cerebral palsy can use the GMFCS – E&R."** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

**"Parents of children with cerebral palsy aged 6 to 12 years have been shown to be accurate in classifying their children using an adapted version of the GMFCS – E&R."** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

### Ease of Use

**"Therapists and physicians can reliably use the GMFCS – E&R with no training simply by reading the criteria. Service providers familiar with a child can complete the GMFCS – E&R in less than 5 minutes."** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

## Stability of Classifications

**"The most recent information indicates that GMFCS - E&R levels are quite stable after 2 years of age and children are not likely to change levels even following intervention."** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

## Applications

According to CanChild, the GMFCS - E&R has multiple applications: <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

- **Clinical Practice**: "A child should first be classified when referred for rehabilitation services to assist with realistic goal setting and appropriate intervention planning."
- **Teaching**: "In teaching, the GMFCS - E&R is a very useful tool to introduce students and service providers in all disciplines to the complexities of cerebral palsy"
- **Administration**: "In administration, the GMFCS - E&R is useful in terms of caseload management and resource allocation"

## Important Limitations

**"The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) is a classification tool used to describe levels of gross motor functioning of children with cerebral palsy. Here we explain why the GMFCS should not be used outside the domain of cerebral palsy."** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

## Availability

**"The GMFCS - E&R brochure can be downloaded at no cost for personal, non-commercial use. Distribution of the GMFCS - E&R has been made possible through a grant from the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Education Foundation in the United States."** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />

For commercial use: **"If wishing to license the GMFCS - E&R and it's variations for commercial clinical trials, industry sponsored research, or integration into electronic health records, please contact us at ccstore@mcmaster.ca"** <Cite slug="canchild-gmfcs" />
