# Manual Ability Classification System (MACS)

## Official Source

The official website for MACS is [www.macs.nu](https://www.macs.nu/). This is the primary source for information about the Manual Ability Classification System.

## Overview

According to the official MACS website and research publications, **"The Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) describes how children with cerebral palsy use their hands to handle objects in daily activities."** <Cite slug="macs-official" /> It is used for children aged from 4 to 18 years old with cerebral palsy, with a focus on the use of both hands together.

## Key Features

**"MACS describes five levels. The levels are based on the children's self-initiated ability to handle objects and their need for assistance or adaptation to perform manual activities in everyday life."** <Cite slug="macs-official" />

**"The classification is designed to reflect the child's typical manual performance, not the child's maximal capacity. It classifies the collaborative use of both hands together."** <Cite slug="macs-official" />

## The Five MACS Levels

According to the MACS classification: <Cite slug="macs-official" />
- **MACS Level I** - Objects are handled easily and successfully
- **MACS Level II** - Handles most objects but with some reduced quality and/or speed
- **MACS Level III** - Handles objects with difficulty – the child will need help to prepare and/or modify activities

(Levels IV and V involve increasingly limited ability to handle objects and greater need for assistance)

## Reliability and Validity

A study published in PubMed demonstrated: **"The results demonstrated that MACS has good validity and reliability, with an intraclass correlation coefficient between therapists of 0.97 and between parents and therapist of 0.96, indicating excellent agreement."** <Cite slug="pubmed-16780622" />

## Additional Versions

**"A version of the test for children under the age of four years old, the Mini-MACS, was developed in 2016."** <Cite slug="macs-official" />

The official MACS website provides resources in multiple languages, with recent additions including Vietnamese and Bulgarian translations. <Cite slug="macs-official" />

## Clinical Use

The MACS is maintained by the developers and provides downloadable resources, leaflets, and comprehensive information about implementing the MACS system through the official website at [www.macs.nu](https://www.macs.nu/). <Cite slug="macs-official" />
