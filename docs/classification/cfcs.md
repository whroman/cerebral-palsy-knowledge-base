# Communication Function Classification System (CFCS)

## Official Source

The official CFCS website is available at [http://cfcs.us](http://cfcs.us), which includes additional resources and frequently asked questions.

## Overview

According to the developers: **"The Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) was created and validated for children with cerebral palsy (CP) that can be used by a wide variety of individuals who are interested in CP."** [^1]

**"The CFCS is a tool used to classify the everyday communication of an individual with cerebral palsy into one of five levels according to effectiveness of communication."** [^2]

## Development and Validation

According to the original research publication: **"An 11-member development team created comprehensive descriptions of the CFCS levels, and four nominal groups comprising 27 participants critiqued these levels. Within a Delphi survey, 112 participants commented on the clarity and usefulness of the CFCS. Interrater reliability was completed by 61 professionals and 68 parents/relatives who classified 69 children with CP aged 2 to 18 years."** [^1]

**"The CFCS demonstrates content validity and shows very good test-retest reliability, good professional interrater reliability, and moderate parent-professional interrater reliability."** [^1]

## Key Features

**"The Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) provides 5 levels (CFCS I, II, III, IV, V) to describe everyday communication performance."** [^3]

**"The CFCS is a valid measure in cerebral palsy that assesses everyday communication (not optimal communication). The CFCS is a simple, five-point ordinal classification system, and was designed to be analogous and complementary to the GMFCS and MACS."** [^3]

## The Five CFCS Levels

According to the published research: [^1]
- **Level I**: Child with CP is an effective sender and receiver with unfamiliar and familiar partners
- **Level II**: Child with CP is an effective but slower paced sender and/or receiver with unfamiliar and familiar partners
- **Level III**: Child with CP is an effective sender and receiver with familiar partners
- **Level IV**: Child with CP is sometimes an effective sender and receiver with familiar partners
- **Level V**: Child with CP is seldom an effective sender and receiver even with familiar partners

## Communication Methods

**"Being an effective communicator requires both sending and receiving information, and the CFCS accordingly assesses both how information is expressed and how it is received. The CFCS allows all methods of communication (e.g., vocalizations, manual signs, eye gaze, pictures, communication boards, speech generating devices) to be included when assessing an individual's classification."** [^3]

**"In this way, the CFCS is inclusive and descriptive for individuals who do not vocalize to communicate."** [^3]

## Integration with Other Classification Systems

According to research: **"Combining the CFCS with the Gross Motor Function Classification System and the Manual Ability Classification System contributes to a functional performance view of daily life for individuals with CP, in accordance with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health."** [^1]

**"The CFCS is analogous and complementary to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS-ER), the Manual Ability Classification System (MACS), and the Eating and Drinking Ability Classification System (EDACS)."** [^3]

**"CFCS is a tool developed with support from the National Institute of Health (NIH), the Cerebral Palsy International Research Foundation, and The Hearst Foundation."** [^3]
