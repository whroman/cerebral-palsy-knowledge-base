# Late Diagnosis and Assessment in Adults

## Understanding Late Diagnosis

Cerebral palsy is caused by brain injury occurring before, during, or shortly after birth. It cannot develop later in life. However, many individuals receive their diagnosis later in childhood or even adulthood, particularly those with milder symptoms.

### Historical Diagnosis Timing

**"Historically, the diagnosis of cerebral palsy was made between the ages of 12 to 24 months."** <Cite slug="pubmed-28715518" />

With advances in diagnostic tools, earlier diagnosis is now possible: **"Cerebral palsy can now be diagnosed before 6 months corrected age."** <Cite slug="pubmed-28715518" />

### Current Diagnosis Statistics

Despite advances, significant delays persist:

- **"Only 21% of Australian infants receive a cerebral palsy diagnosis by six months of age, while 52% are diagnosed after one year."** <Cite slug="pmc-6832653" />
- **"In low-resource settings like Bangladesh, the average diagnosis age reaches five years."** <Cite slug="pmc-6832653" />

## Barriers to Early Diagnosis

Multiple factors contribute to delayed diagnosis: <Cite slug="pmc-6832653" />

1. Absence of definitive biomarkers for cerebral palsy
2. Difficulty applying the cerebral palsy definition to infants
3. Concern about false positives
4. Neurological signs often don't emerge until after six months

## Importance of Early Diagnosis

**"Late diagnosis means some infants do not receive early intervention when they would benefit most."** <Cite slug="pmc-6832653" />

The benefits of early identification are significant: **"Prompt referral to diagnostic-specific early intervention optimizes infant motor and cognitive plasticity, prevents secondary complications, and enhances caregiver well-being."** <Cite slug="pubmed-28715518" />

## Prognosis

In high-income countries, research indicates:
- 2 in 3 individuals with cerebral palsy will achieve walking ability <Cite slug="pubmed-28715518" />
- 3 in 4 will develop speech <Cite slug="pubmed-28715518" />
- 1 in 2 will have normal intelligence <Cite slug="pubmed-28715518" />
