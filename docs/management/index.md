# Management

Cerebral palsy management requires coordination across multiple specialists. Without a central coordinator, care becomes fragmented—each specialist addresses their piece without seeing the whole picture.

## The Coordination Problem

Adults with cerebral palsy often see:
- Neurologist (seizures, spasticity medications)
- Orthopedist (bone/joint issues)
- PT/OT/SLP (therapy services)
- Primary care (general health)
- Various subspecialists

Without coordination:
- Treatments may conflict
- Gaps in care go unnoticed
- No one tracks overall function
- Aging-related changes missed

## The Physiatrist Solution

Physiatrists (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation physicians) are trained to:
- Coordinate care across specialties
- Assess function holistically
- Manage spasticity
- Oversee rehabilitation services
- Track changes over time

**A physiatrist should be the central coordinator for adult cerebral palsy care.**

## Key Management Areas

| Area | Focus | Specialists |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Spasticity** | Tone management, botulinum toxin, medications | Physiatrist, neurologist |
| **Mobility** | Gait, equipment, transfers | Physiatrist, PT |
| **Pain** | Chronic pain (70% affected) | Physiatrist, pain specialist |
| **Communication** | Speech, AAC | SLP |
| **Daily living** | Independence, adaptations | OT |

## What to Do

1. **Find a physiatrist** - preferably one experienced with cerebral palsy
2. **Establish as primary coordinator** - not just another specialist
3. **Bring records from all providers** - enable coordination
4. **Request annual functional review** - track changes over time
