# Equipment and Assistive Devices for Adults with Cerebral Palsy

Proper equipment can dramatically improve independence, comfort, and quality of life. Equipment needs often change with aging, making regular reassessment essential.

## Categories of Equipment

### Mobility Devices

#### Wheelchairs

**Manual Wheelchairs**
- Self-propelled or attendant-pushed
- Lightweight options for active users
- Custom seating for positioning needs
- Lower cost, no charging required

**Power Wheelchairs**
- Essential when manual propulsion isn't possible
- Various control options (joystick, head array, sip-and-puff)
- Tilt/recline features for pressure relief
- Elevating seats for access and transfers

#### Walkers and Gait Aids

- **Posterior walkers** - better posture than anterior walkers
- **Rollators** - wheeled walkers with seats
- **Crutches** - forearm or platform styles
- **Canes** - for mild balance support

#### Standers

- Enable upright positioning
- Benefits: bone density, digestion, circulation
- Allow hands-free activities
- Prevent contractures from prolonged sitting

### Orthotics

**"Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) reduce energy expenditure during ambulation and prevent joint deformities."** <Cite slug="pmc-10733710" />

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **AFOs (Ankle-Foot Orthoses)** | Foot/ankle positioning, gait improvement |
| **SMOs (Supra-Malleolar Orthoses)** | Heel and foot support, shoe inserts |
| **Knee orthoses** | Knee stability and alignment |
| **Hand/wrist splints** | Improve grasp, prevent contractures |
| **Trunk orthoses** | Scoliosis management, posture support |

#### Getting Orthotics

1. Referral from physiatrist or orthopedist
2. Evaluation by certified orthotist
3. Casting or scanning for custom fit
4. Fitting and adjustments
5. Regular reassessment (fit changes over time)

### Communication Devices (AAC)

Augmentative and Alternative Communication devices for those with speech difficulties:

**Low-Tech Options**
- Communication boards
- Picture exchange systems
- Writing aids

**High-Tech Options**
- Speech-generating devices
- Tablet apps with voice output
- Eye-gaze systems
- Switch-activated devices

### Daily Living Aids

- **Eating** - Adapted utensils, plate guards, non-slip mats
- **Dressing** - Button hooks, zipper pulls, dressing sticks
- **Bathing** - Shower chairs, grab bars, long-handled sponges
- **Toileting** - Raised toilet seats, grab bars, bidets
- **Writing** - Weighted pens, grip aids, slant boards

### Computer Access

- Alternative keyboards (large key, one-handed)
- Mouse alternatives (trackball, joystick, head mouse)
- Voice recognition software
- Switch scanning for those with limited movement
- Eye-tracking systems

## Funding Equipment

### Insurance

- Medicare/Medicaid may cover medically necessary equipment
- Requires prescription and documentation of medical necessity
- Prior authorization often required
- May require specific suppliers

### Vocational Rehabilitation

- Equipment needed for employment
- Varies by state
- Can cover high-cost items like power wheelchairs

### Charitable Organizations

- United Cerebral Palsy chapters
- Easter Seals
- Condition-specific foundations
- Local civic organizations

### Equipment Lending Libraries

Before purchasing expensive equipment, many organizations offer:
- Demo equipment to try
- Short-term loans
- Refurbished equipment at reduced cost

## Working with Specialists

| Specialist | Role |
|------------|------|
| **Physiatrist** | Prescribes equipment, coordinates team |
| **Physical Therapist** | Mobility assessment, training |
| **Occupational Therapist** | ADL equipment, upper extremity aids |
| **Speech-Language Pathologist** | AAC evaluation and training |
| **Orthotist** | Custom braces and orthoses |
| **ATP (Assistive Technology Professional)** | Complex wheelchair seating |
| **Rehabilitation Engineer** | Custom modifications |

## Equipment Updates with Aging

Equipment needs change with age:

- **Increased fatigue** → May need power mobility earlier
- **Reduced strength** → Lighter equipment, power assists
- **Pain** → Better positioning, pressure management
- **Changing body** → Refitting orthotics, new seating

**Regular reassessment is essential**—what worked at 20 may not work at 40.

## Key Points

- Equipment should be prescribed by appropriate specialists
- Try before you buy when possible
- Custom fitting is essential for orthotics and wheelchairs
- Multiple funding sources may be needed
- Needs change with aging—plan for reassessment
- Good equipment improves independence and quality of life
- Poor fit or wrong equipment can cause harm
