# Pain Management in Adults with Cerebral Palsy

Chronic pain affects the majority of adults with cerebral palsy and significantly impacts quality of life, yet it often goes unrecognized and undertreated.

## Prevalence

**"A meta-analysis revealed a high pain prevalence of 70% (95% CI 62-78) in adults with cerebral palsy."** <Cite slug="pubmed-32061920" />

This means 7 out of 10 adults with cerebral palsy experience chronic pain—a rate far higher than the general population.

## Pain Locations

Research from a North American registry found: **"Back and weight-bearing joints of lower extremities were most frequently reported as painful."** <Cite slug="pubmed-37993325" />

Common pain locations include:
- **Back** - from postural abnormalities and muscle imbalances
- **Hips** - weight-bearing stress, possible dysplasia
- **Knees** - gait abnormalities, crouch walking
- **Legs** - 76% of pain reported in legs <Cite slug="pubmed-32061920" />

## Impact on Function and Quality of Life

Pain in adults with cerebral palsy affects multiple domains:

**"Those with moderate-to-severe pain showed increased depression, reduced social role satisfaction, and lower extremity function decline."** <Cite slug="pubmed-37993325" />

Key impacts:
- Pain interference positively correlated with depression
- Pain interference negatively correlated with physical function
- Pain interference negatively correlated with social participation
- Women report higher pain rates than men <Cite slug="pubmed-32061920" />

## Pain Severity

Mean pain severity is 3.7/10 with mean interference of 3.5/10. <Cite slug="pubmed-32061920" /> Notably, **pain severity does not significantly differ across GMFCS levels or age groups**—meaning ambulatory and non-ambulatory individuals are equally affected. <Cite slug="pubmed-37993325" />

## Contributing Factors

Pain in cerebral palsy results from multiple interacting factors:

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| **Spasticity** | Chronic muscle tension and spasms |
| **Abnormal gait** | Stress on joints from compensatory movement patterns |
| **Postural abnormalities** | Scoliosis, hip displacement, contractures |
| **Overuse** | Compensating for weakness in some muscle groups |
| **Aging** | Early degenerative changes (30s-40s vs 60s-70s in general population) |

## Treatment Approaches

### Nonpharmacologic Interventions (First-Line)

Research shows **"nonpharmacologic interventions were most commonly cited as beneficial"** by adults with cerebral palsy. <Cite slug="pubmed-37993325" />

- **Physical therapy** - stretching, strengthening, positioning
- **Occupational therapy** - activity modification, adaptive equipment
- **Aquatic therapy** - reduced joint stress
- **Heat/cold therapy** - muscle relaxation, inflammation reduction
- **Positioning** - proper seating and sleeping positions

### Pharmacologic Options

- **Oral medications** - NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, neuropathic pain agents
- **Botulinum toxin** - for spasticity-related pain
- **Intrathecal baclofen** - for severe, generalized spasticity

### Spasticity Management

Reducing spasticity often reduces pain. A meta-analysis found intrathecal baclofen achieved **"a 40.25% reduction"** in spasticity scores. <Cite slug="pubmed-38678195" />

## Screening Recommendations

**"Adults with cerebral palsy should be routinely screened for pain and treated accordingly."** <Cite slug="pubmed-32061920" />

Recommended approach:
1. Screen for pain at every visit
2. Use validated pain scales appropriate to communication ability
3. Ask about pain location, severity, and interference
4. Assess impact on function and participation
5. Address underlying causes (spasticity, positioning, overuse)

## Key Points

- Pain affects 70% of adults with cerebral palsy
- Back and lower extremity joints are most commonly affected
- Pain severity is similar across all GMFCS levels
- Nonpharmacologic approaches are preferred first-line treatment
- Routine screening is essential—pain is often underrecognized
- Untreated pain leads to depression, reduced function, and social isolation
