# Orthopedics & Hip Management in Adults with Cerebral Palsy

Adults with cerebral palsy frequently develop hip problems that cause pain and functional limitation. Unlike children, where surveillance can prevent displacement, adults often need treatment for established hip disease.

## Hip Problems in Adults

Hip subluxation and dislocation are common in cerebral palsy due to:
- Muscle imbalance from spasticity
- Abnormal positioning and lack of weight-bearing
- Progressive displacement from childhood
- Degenerative changes with aging

### Risk by Motor Function

Hip displacement correlates strongly with motor function level. Risk ranges from 1% with spastic hemiplegia to 75% with spastic quadriplegia. <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />

| GMFCS Level | Hip Displacement Risk |
|-------------|----------------------|
| I (walks without aids) | ~1% <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" /> |
| II-III (walks with aids) | Moderate |
| IV-V (wheelchair users) | Up to 75% <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" /> |

## Total Hip Arthroplasty (Hip Replacement)

### Evidence Summary

A 2020 systematic review of 9 studies found positive outcomes for hip replacement in adults with cerebral palsy: <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />

| Outcome | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **Pain relief** | 87% achieved significant pain relief |
| **Functional improvement** | 79% improved function |
| **5-year implant survival** | 93.6% |
| **10-15 year survival** | 81-95% |

**"Total hip arthroplasty is a viable treatment option for adults with cerebral palsy."** <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />

### Benefits

- Significant pain reduction <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />
- Improved positioning (sitting, lying)
- Easier personal care and hygiene <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />
- Better quality of life
- Long-term durability comparable to general population

### Complications

Adults with cerebral palsy have higher complication rates than typical hip replacement patients: <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />

| Complication | Rate |
|--------------|------|
| **Dislocation** | 7.5% (range 0-28%) |
| **Periprosthetic fracture** | 5.6% (range 0-21%) |
| **Heterotopic ossification** | 4.2% (range 0-38%) |
| **Loosening** | 3.7% (range 0-15%) |
| **Infection** | 2.1% (range 0-17%) |

**Revision rates vary from 0-26%**, higher than the general population. <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />

### Indications for Surgery

Common reasons for hip replacement in cerebral palsy: <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />

1. **Painful degenerative joint disease** (most common)
2. Hip subluxation or dislocation
3. Secondary osteoarthritis from dysplasia
4. Failed treatment for fracture
5. Failure of non-operative pain management

## Hip Surveillance (Pediatric to Adult Transition)

Hip surveillance programs monitor children for hip displacement. Standard recommendations include:
- Early initiation (typically by age 2 or at diagnosis)
- Regular clinical and radiographic monitoring
- More frequent surveillance for GMFCS III-V
- Continuing until skeletal maturity

**Gap in adult care:** Surveillance protocols focus on children. Adults may present with advanced hip disease that was missed or progressed after pediatric care ended.

## Other Orthopedic Issues

### Scoliosis

**46% of adults with cerebral palsy have scoliosis** <Cite slug="pubmed-36807150" /> (see [Secondary Conditions](../understanding/co-occurring/secondary-conditions.md)).

Management considerations:
- Seating and positioning assessment
- Bracing for comfort (not curve correction in adults)
- Surgical evaluation for severe, progressive curves
- Monitor respiratory impact

### Osteoporosis

Adults with cerebral palsy have elevated fracture risk due to:
- Limited weight-bearing
- Anticonvulsant medications
- Vitamin D deficiency
- Low muscle mass

Prevention:
- Weight-bearing when possible
- Vitamin D supplementation
- Calcium intake monitoring
- Earlier bone density screening than general population

## Specialist Team

| Specialist | Role |
|------------|------|
| **Orthopedic surgeon** | Surgical evaluation and treatment |
| **Physiatrist** | Non-operative management, coordination |
| **Physical therapist** | Pre/post-operative rehabilitation |
| **Pain specialist** | Non-operative pain management |

## Decision-Making Considerations

When considering hip surgery in adults with cerebral palsy:

**Factors favoring surgery:**
- Significant pain uncontrolled by medications
- Pain affecting sleep, positioning, quality of life
- Progressive functional decline
- Ability to participate in post-operative care

**Challenges:**
- Higher complication rates than general population
- Need for specialized surgical expertise
- Post-operative rehabilitation may be complex
- May need general anesthesia considerations

## Key Points

- Hip problems are common in adults with cerebral palsy, especially GMFCS IV-V
- Total hip arthroplasty provides significant pain relief (87%) and functional improvement (79%) <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />
- Complication rates are higher than general population but manageable <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />
- Implant survival is comparable to standard populations (81-95% at 10-15 years) <Cite slug="pmc-7016022" />
- Adults may present with advanced hip disease missed in pediatric care
- Orthopedic surgeon experienced with neuromuscular conditions is essential
