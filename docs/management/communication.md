# Communication Strategies for Adults with Cerebral Palsy

Many adults with cerebral palsy experience communication challenges. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) provides effective tools to improve expressive and receptive communication.

## Evidence for AAC

**"Moderate-quality evidence that AAC interventions improve the receptive and expressive communication skills in patients with cerebral palsy"** <Cite slug="pubmed-34378726" />

Research shows:
- **"High-quality evidence that AAC is improving communication at medium and long-term interventions when compared to speech therapy or no therapy"** <Cite slug="pubmed-34378726" />
- Benefits persist over time, not just during therapy
- AAC is more effective than speech therapy alone for many individuals

## Understanding AAC

AAC encompasses all forms of communication other than oral speech. The goal is effective communication, not replacing speech.

### Low-Tech AAC

No batteries or electronics required:

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Communication boards** | Pictures, symbols, or words on a board | Predictable conversations, specific contexts |
| **Picture exchange (PECS)** | Trading pictures to communicate | Requesting, choice-making |
| **Alphabet boards** | Pointing to letters | Those who can spell |
| **Eye gaze boards** | Looking at symbols/letters | Limited hand movement |
| **Gestures and signs** | Modified sign language | Quick communication |

### High-Tech AAC

Electronic devices with speech output:

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Speech-generating devices** | Dedicated communication devices | Full-time AAC users |
| **Tablet apps** | Communication apps on iPad/Android | Flexibility, portability |
| **Eye-tracking systems** | Computer controlled by eye movement | Minimal motor control |
| **Switch-scanning** | Selecting items using switches | Those who can activate a switch |
| **Head-tracking** | Mouse control via head movement | Limited hand use, good head control |

## Key Factors for Success

**"Diversity of cerebral palsy patients requires proper analysis of determinant variables to ensure the efficacy of AAC assessment and intervention"** <Cite slug="pubmed-34378726" />

Successful AAC implementation depends on:

### Individual Assessment

- Motor abilities (pointing, eye gaze, switch use)
- Cognitive and language skills
- Vision and hearing
- Positioning needs
- Communication partners and environments
- Personal preferences and motivation

### Environmental Factors

- Training for communication partners (family, caregivers, staff)
- AAC availability across all settings
- Regular vocabulary updates
- Maintenance and technical support

### Ongoing Support

AAC is not a one-time intervention:
- Regular reassessment as needs change
- Vocabulary expansion
- Device updates and repairs
- Training for new communication partners

## Access Methods

How a person physically interacts with their AAC system:

| Method | How It Works | Motor Requirements |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Direct selection** | Pointing with finger | Hand coordination |
| **Eye gaze** | Looking at selections | Reliable eye movement |
| **Head pointing** | Using head-mounted pointer | Head control |
| **Switch scanning** | Pressing switch to select | Ability to activate switch |
| **Partner-assisted** | Partner helps with selection | Minimal motor |

## Common Barriers

### Myths About AAC

- "AAC will prevent speech development" — Research shows AAC often improves verbal speech
- "Must have certain cognitive level" — AAC can benefit people across cognitive abilities
- "Too old to start" — Adults can successfully learn AAC at any age
- "One device fits all" — AAC must be individually matched

### Practical Barriers

- Cost and funding
- Limited access to specialists
- Insufficient training
- Technology breakdowns
- Changing needs over time

## Getting Started

Steps toward AAC implementation:

1. **Request evaluation** - Speech-language pathologist with AAC expertise
2. **Trial different options** - Low-tech and high-tech
3. **Consider funding** - Insurance, Medicaid, grants, state programs
4. **Train everyone** - User and all communication partners
5. **Integrate into daily life** - AAC should be available everywhere
6. **Follow up** - Regular reassessment and updates

## CFCS Connection

The [Communication Function Classification System (CFCS)](../understanding/cfcs.md) describes a person's everyday communication effectiveness but does not prescribe specific AAC types. Someone at any CFCS level may benefit from AAC interventions.

## Key Points

- AAC has high-quality evidence for improving communication outcomes
- Both low-tech and high-tech options are valid
- Individual assessment is essential—no one-size-fits-all solution
- AAC supports rather than replaces speech
- Communication partners need training too
- Ongoing support and updates are necessary
