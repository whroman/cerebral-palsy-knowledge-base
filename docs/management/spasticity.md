# Spasticity Management in Adults with Cerebral Palsy

Spasticity—increased muscle tone causing stiffness and resistance to movement—is a core feature of cerebral palsy that requires ongoing management throughout life.

## Why Spasticity Management Matters

Unmanaged spasticity leads to:
- Chronic pain (affects 70% of adults) <Cite slug="pubmed-32061920" />
- Contractures and deformities
- Reduced function and independence
- Difficulty with positioning and caregiving
- Sleep disruption

## Treatment Hierarchy

Spasticity management follows a stepped approach from least to most invasive:

### 1. Physical Interventions (First-Line)

- **Stretching** - Regular range of motion exercises
- **Positioning** - Proper seating, sleeping positions
- **Orthotics** - Splints, braces to maintain position
- **Physical therapy** - Strengthening, functional training

### 2. Oral Medications

Oral medications reduce generalized spasticity but have limited evidence and significant side effects.

**"The American Academy of Neurology states there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of oral baclofen for cerebral palsy spasticity."** <Cite slug="pmc-7901132" />

| Medication | Mechanism | Common Side Effects |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Baclofen** | GABAB receptor agonist | Drowsiness, weakness, tolerance |
| **Tizanidine** | Alpha-2 agonist | Drowsiness, dry mouth |
| **Diazepam** | GABA enhancer | Sedation, dependence |
| **Dantrolene** | Muscle relaxant | Hepatotoxicity, weakness |

**"Although oral baclofen is not as effective for cerebral spasticity as it is for spinal spasticity, it remains commonly prescribed."** <Cite slug="pmc-10116133" />

#### Managing Side Effects

- **Drowsiness** - Administer doses at bedtime
- **Tolerance** (3-20% of patients) - "Baclofen holidays" of 3-37 days can restore effectiveness <Cite slug="pmc-10116133" />
- **Constipation** - Manageable with laxatives

### 3. Botulinum Toxin Injections

For focal spasticity affecting specific muscle groups:

**"Three Class I trials documented significant improvement in gait pattern in children with gastrocnemius spasticity."** <Cite slug="pubmed-19142573" />

- Targets specific muscles
- Effects last 3-6 months
- Requires repeat injections
- **"Adverse events were mild and self-limited. The most common complaints were pain in the injection sites and transient weakness."** <Cite slug="pubmed-19142573" />

Best for:
- Equinovarus foot deformity
- Specific muscle groups causing functional problems
- Combined with stretching and casting

### 4. Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB)

For severe, generalized spasticity not controlled by other methods:

A meta-analysis found **"average spasticity scores decreased from 3.2 to 1.9, representing a 40.25% reduction"** with ITB therapy. <Cite slug="pubmed-38678195" />

#### Benefits <Cite slug="pubmed-38678195" />
- 40% spasticity reduction <Cite slug="pubmed-38678195" />
- Modest motor function improvement (9.62%) <Cite slug="pubmed-38678195" />
- Continuous delivery directly to spinal cord
- Avoids oral medication side effects

#### Risks <Cite slug="pubmed-38678195" />

Complications in 203 of 501 implantations: <Cite slug="pubmed-38678195" />
- Infections: 16.26% <Cite slug="pubmed-38678195" />
- Meningitis: 3.94% <Cite slug="pubmed-38678195" />
- Catheter problems: 75 cases

Requires:
- Surgical implantation of pump
- Regular refills (every 1-6 months)
- Lifelong maintenance
- Emergency access if pump fails

### 5. Surgical Options

For severe cases or established deformities:
- **Selective dorsal rhizotomy** - Cutting nerve rootlets
- **Orthopedic surgery** - Tendon lengthening, osteotomies

## Specialist Roles

| Specialist | Role in Spasticity Management |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| **Physiatrist** | Primary coordinator, oral medications, botulinum toxin |
| **Neurologist** | Complex medication management |
| **Orthopedist** | Surgical interventions |
| **Physical therapist** | Stretching, strengthening, positioning |
| **Neurosurgeon** | ITB pump placement, selective dorsal rhizotomy |

## Key Points

- Start with physical interventions before medications
- Oral medications have limited evidence but can help generalized spasticity
- Botulinum toxin is effective for focal spasticity affecting specific muscles
- Intrathecal baclofen provides significant reduction for severe cases but requires surgical implantation
- A physiatrist should coordinate spasticity management as part of overall care
- Regular reassessment needed—spasticity patterns change with aging
