# Transitioning from Pediatric to Adult Care

The transition from pediatric to adult healthcare is often called the "transition cliff"—a point where comprehensive pediatric services end and fragmented adult services begin.

## The Transition Problem

A systematic review found significant gaps in transitional care: **"No standardized transition tool or approach exists across programs."** <Cite slug="pubmed-37552305" />

Without proper transition:

**"Transition-associated poor outcomes included housing instability, unemployment, difficulty forming relationships, increased hospital admission rates, and decreased use of rehabilitation services."** <Cite slug="pubmed-37552305" />

## Why Transition Is Difficult

### System Barriers

- **Limited adult providers** - Few adult specialists see cerebral palsy patients
- **Poor communication** - Pediatric and adult teams don't coordinate
- **Financial gaps** - Specialized care resources are lacking
- **No standardization** - Every program (if one exists) works differently

### Patient/Family Barriers

- Lack of preparation for transition
- Difficulty navigating adult healthcare system
- Loss of established relationships with pediatric providers
- Not knowing who to see or when

## When Transition Happens

| Age | Typical Milestone |
|-----|-------------------|
| 14-16 | Begin discussing transition |
| 16-18 | Identify adult providers |
| 18-21 | Active transition period |
| 21-25 | Final transfer of care |

In reality, many adults with cerebral palsy never complete a proper transition—they simply "age out" of pediatric services.

## What Good Transition Looks Like

### Protective Factors

Research shows better outcomes when transition includes: <Cite slug="pubmed-37552305" />

1. **Family involvement** - Caregivers engaged in planning
2. **Self-efficacy promotion** - Teaching self-advocacy skills
3. **Early introduction to adult team** - Meeting providers before full transition

### Ideal Transition Process

1. **Readiness Assessment** (14-16 years)
   - Evaluate medical complexity
   - Assess self-care abilities
   - Identify transition goals

2. **Preparation Phase** (16-18 years)
   - Create portable medical summary
   - Teach self-advocacy skills
   - Research adult providers
   - Understand insurance changes

3. **Transfer Phase** (18-21 years)
   - Introduce to adult providers
   - Overlap visits (pediatric and adult)
   - Transfer records
   - Establish care coordination

4. **Post-Transfer Support** (21-25 years)
   - Check-in on care continuity
   - Address gaps that emerge
   - Connect to adult services

## Creating Your Transition Plan

### Medical Summary

Compile:
- Complete diagnosis and medical history
- Current medications and dosages
- All specialists and their contact information
- Recent test results and imaging
- Equipment and suppliers
- Insurance information
- Emergency contacts and plans

### Find Adult Providers

Key specialists to identify:
- **Physiatrist** - Primary coordinator
- **Primary care physician** - General health
- **Neurologist** - If managing seizures or spasticity medications
- **Orthopedist** - If ongoing bone/joint issues
- **Therapists** - PT, OT, SLP as needed

### Questions for New Providers

1. "How many adults with cerebral palsy do you currently treat?"
2. "Are you willing to coordinate with my other specialists?"
3. "Can I schedule a 'meet and greet' visit before transferring care?"
4. "How will you communicate with my previous pediatric team?"

## For Those Who Never Transitioned

Many adults with cerebral palsy never had a formal transition—they were simply told at some point that they were "too old" for pediatric services.

If this is you:
1. Start with a physiatrist or PM&R specialist
2. Gather whatever records exist from childhood
3. Request comprehensive adult assessment
4. Build your care team from scratch if necessary
5. Don't let lack of documentation prevent you from getting care

## Transition Resources

### Organizations

- **Got Transition** - National transition resource center
- **United Cerebral Palsy** - Local chapter resources
- **CPRN (Cerebral Palsy Research Network)** - Research and resources

### What to Bring to New Appointments

- Medical summary (paper and electronic)
- List of current medications
- List of all providers with contact info
- Recent test results
- Questions written down
- Support person if needed

## Key Points

- Transition is often poorly managed—plan proactively
- Start transition discussions by age 14-16
- Create a comprehensive portable medical summary
- Meet adult providers before fully leaving pediatric care
- Family involvement and self-advocacy improve outcomes
- If you never transitioned properly, it's not too late to establish adult care
