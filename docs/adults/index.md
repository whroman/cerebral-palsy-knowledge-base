# Adults with Cerebral Palsy

Cerebral palsy was historically considered a childhood condition. Many adults with cerebral palsy face gaps in care, outdated assessments, and providers unfamiliar with adult-specific needs.

## The Adult Care Gap

Common challenges for adults:
- **Transition cliff** - pediatric services end, adult services unclear
- **Provider inexperience** - many adult providers rarely see cerebral palsy
- **Outdated records** - last assessment was in childhood
- **Aging effects** - changes begin earlier than typical population
- **Late or missed diagnosis** - some adults never formally diagnosed

## Adults Are Different

Adult cerebral palsy care differs from pediatric care:

| Pediatric Focus | Adult Focus |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Development, growth | Maintenance, aging |
| Parent-driven care | Self-advocacy, caregiver support |
| School-based services | Community-based services |
| Future planning | Current function, quality of life |

## Aging with Cerebral Palsy

Adults with cerebral palsy experience aging-related changes earlier:
- Increased fatigue (often starting in 30s)
- Joint/muscle pain from years of atypical movement
- Reduced mobility and function
- Need for updated equipment

**"Young adults with cerebral palsy experience problems with aging that non-disabled adults experience 'much later in life'"** <Cite slug="pmc-7756828" />

## What to Do

1. **Get adult-appropriate assessment** - childhood records aren't enough
2. **Find providers experienced with adult cerebral palsy** - ask directly
3. **Establish physiatrist as coordinator** - prevents fragmented care
4. **Plan for aging** - proactive, not reactive
5. **Connect with adult cerebral palsy organizations** - peer support, resources
