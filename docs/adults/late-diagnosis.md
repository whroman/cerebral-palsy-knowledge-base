# Late Diagnosis and Assessment in Adults

## Understanding Late Diagnosis

Cerebral palsy is caused by brain injury occurring before, during, or shortly after birth. It cannot develop later in life. However, many individuals receive their diagnosis later in childhood or even adulthood, particularly those with milder symptoms.

### Historical Diagnosis Timing

**"Historically, the diagnosis of cerebral palsy was made between the ages of 12 to 24 months."** [^1]

With advances in diagnostic tools, earlier diagnosis is now possible: **"Cerebral palsy can now be diagnosed before 6 months corrected age."** [^1]

### Current Diagnosis Statistics

Despite advances, significant delays persist:

- **"Only 21% of Australian infants receive a cerebral palsy diagnosis by six months of age, while 52% are diagnosed after one year."** [^2]
- **"In low-resource settings like Bangladesh, the average diagnosis age reaches five years."** [^2]

Research from Nepal found: **"Parents recognized the symptoms of cerebral palsy at mean age of 13 months"** with **"a mean delay of 23 months between symptom recognition and seeking medical help"** resulting in **"the mean age of diagnosis was 5½ years."** [^3]

## Barriers to Early Diagnosis

Multiple factors contribute to delayed diagnosis: [^2]

1. Absence of definitive biomarkers for cerebral palsy
2. Difficulty applying the cerebral palsy definition to infants
3. Concern about false positives
4. Neurological signs often don't emerge until after six months

## Importance of Early Diagnosis

**"Most children with cerebral palsy are diagnosed during the first two years of life, but if the child has mild symptoms, it may be difficult to make a diagnosis until later in childhood."** [^4]

**"Late diagnosis means some infants do not receive early intervention when they would benefit most."** [^5]

The benefits of early identification are significant: **"Prompt referral to diagnostic-specific early intervention optimizes infant motor and cognitive plasticity, prevents secondary complications, and enhances caregiver well-being."** [^1]

## Prognosis

In high-income countries, research indicates: [^1]
- 2 in 3 individuals with cerebral palsy will achieve walking ability
- 3 in 4 will develop speech
- 1 in 2 will have normal intelligence
