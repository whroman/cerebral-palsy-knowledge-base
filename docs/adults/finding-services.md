# Finding Adult Services for Cerebral Palsy

Many adults with cerebral palsy struggle to find appropriate care. Unlike pediatric services, adult cerebral palsy care is not centralized, and many providers have limited experience with the condition.

## The Challenge

Finding adult services is difficult because:
- **Few specialized programs** - most cerebral palsy services focus on children
- **Provider inexperience** - many adult providers rarely see cerebral palsy
- **Fragmented care** - services scattered across multiple specialties
- **Geographic gaps** - specialized clinics exist only in major medical centers

## What to Look For

### Specialized Adult Cerebral Palsy Clinics

The gold standard is a dedicated adult cerebral palsy clinic. These programs provide:

**"Physiatrists and physical medicine and rehabilitation experts guide patients in comprehensive care including functional issues, spasticity and pain management, and physical therapy exercises."** <Cite slug="utsw-adult-cp" />

Features of specialized clinics:
- Physiatrist-led coordination
- Multidisciplinary team access
- Understanding of adult-specific issues
- Experience with aging-related changes

### Multidisciplinary Teams

**"Your care team includes orthopedic surgeons, physiatrists, interventional spine care specialists, social workers, physical therapists and neurosurgeons."** <Cite slug="ucla-cp-program" />

Key specialists to access:
- **Physiatrist** (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation) - primary coordinator
- **Neurologist** - medications, seizures
- **Orthopedist** - bone and joint issues
- **Physical therapist** - mobility, strengthening
- **Occupational therapist** - daily living, equipment
- **Speech-language pathologist** - communication, swallowing

### Care Coordination

**"Having care coordinators on board is absolutely essential."** <Cite slug="cleveland-adult-cp" />

Good programs have:
- Dedicated care coordinators
- Communication between team members
- Single point of contact for patients
- Transition support from pediatric to adult care

## Example Programs

Several major medical centers have established adult cerebral palsy programs:

| Program | Location | Approach |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **UT Southwestern** | Dallas, TX | PM&R-led comprehensive clinic |
| **University of Michigan** | Ann Arbor, MI | Multidisciplinary with research focus |
| **Cleveland Clinic** | Cleveland, OH | Coordinated care with transitions |
| **UCLA Health** | Los Angeles, CA | Orthopedics and PM&R partnership |

## If No Specialized Clinic Exists

Most areas don't have specialized adult cerebral palsy clinics. In this case:

### Step 1: Find a Physiatrist

Start with a physiatrist who can serve as coordinator:
- Search "[your city] physiatrist adult cerebral palsy"
- Call PM&R departments at academic medical centers
- Ask: "Do you see adults with cerebral palsy?"

### Step 2: Build Your Team

The physiatrist can refer to other specialists as needed:

**"Depending on individual needs, a patient may see a Primary Care doctor, a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation doctor, a Neurologist, an Orthopedic Surgeon, and doctors specializing in other areas of medicine where needed."** <Cite slug="cprn-functional-decline" />

### Step 3: Coordinate Care Yourself

Without a care coordinator, you may need to:
- Keep your own records of all providers
- Ensure test results are shared between doctors
- Track medications and avoid duplications
- Communicate changes to all relevant providers

## Questions to Ask Providers

When evaluating potential providers, ask:

1. "How many adults with cerebral palsy do you currently see?"
2. "Are you familiar with aging-related changes in cerebral palsy?"
3. "Can you coordinate with other specialists I need to see?"
4. "Do you have experience with spasticity management?"
5. "Will you communicate with my other providers?"

## Red Flags

Be cautious of providers who:
- Have never treated an adult with cerebral palsy
- Focus only on their specialty without considering the whole picture
- Dismiss concerns as "just part of cerebral palsy"
- Don't communicate with other providers
- Lack accessible facilities

## Resources

### Organizations

- **Cerebral Palsy Research Network (CPRN)** - Research and resources
- **United Cerebral Palsy** - Local chapters with service connections
- **American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine** - Provider directory

### Online Communities

- Peer support groups for adults with cerebral palsy
- Caregiver support networks
- Condition-specific forums

## Key Points

- Specialized adult cerebral palsy clinics are rare but ideal
- A physiatrist should coordinate care when possible
- Academic medical centers are most likely to have experience
- Ask directly about provider experience with adult cerebral palsy
- Be prepared to coordinate your own care if no specialized clinic exists
- Multidisciplinary access is essential—avoid fragmented care
