# Co-occurring Conditions

Cerebral palsy rarely occurs in isolation. The same early brain injury or development differences that cause cerebral palsy often affect other systems, leading to co-occurring conditions that require separate assessment and treatment.

## Why Co-occurrence Matters

Understanding co-occurrence:
- Prevents missed diagnoses (autism often overlooked)
- Explains symptoms beyond motor impairment
- Guides appropriate specialist referrals
- Improves quality of life through complete care

## Common Co-occurring Conditions

| Condition | Prevalence in Cerebral Palsy | General Population |
|-----------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Autism** | 6-9% | 1-2% |
| **Intellectual disability** | ~50% | 1-3% |
| **Epilepsy** | 25-45% | ~1% |
| **ADHD** | ~25% | 5-7% |
| **Chronic pain** | 70% | ~20% |
| **Depression/anxiety** | Higher rates | - |

## The Diagnostic Challenge

Co-occurring conditions are often missed because:
- **Diagnostic overshadowing** - all symptoms attributed to cerebral palsy
- **Assessment tool limitations** - standard tests assume typical motor function
- **Specialty silos** - neurologists focus on motor, miss autism
- **"Already diagnosed"** - cerebral palsy diagnosis stops further evaluation

## Cerebral Palsy vs Autism: Classification Difference

Despite high co-occurrence, these are classified differently:
- **Cerebral palsy**: Neurological (ICD-11 Chapter 8 - Diseases of the nervous system)
- **Autism**: Neurodevelopmental (DSM-5/ICD-11 - Neurodevelopmental Disorders)

This matters because different specialists diagnose and treat each condition.

## What to Do

1. **Request autism screening** - especially if social/communication differences noted
2. **Get neuropsychological testing** - for cognitive and behavioral assessment
3. **Don't assume symptoms are "just cerebral palsy"** - investigate separately
4. **Seek providers experienced in co-occurrence** - avoid specialists who only see one condition
