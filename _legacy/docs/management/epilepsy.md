# Epilepsy & Seizure Management in Cerebral Palsy

Epilepsy is one of the most common co-occurring conditions in cerebral palsy, affecting about half of all individuals. Understanding seizure risks and management is essential for comprehensive care.

## Prevalence

| Finding | Statistic | Source |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Epilepsy in adults with cerebral palsy/intellectual disability | 55.6% | <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" /> |
| Epilepsy in large cerebral palsy population (N=88,138) | 51% | <Cite slug="pubmed-39596993" /> |
| Drug-resistant epilepsy | 22.4% | <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" /> |
| Seizure recurrence after medication withdrawal | 42.3% | <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" /> |

**Nearly 1 in 2 people with cerebral palsy has epilepsy.** <Cite slug="pubmed-39596993" />

## Risk Factors by Cerebral Palsy Subtype

A large-scale population study of 88,138 patients found that specific cerebral palsy subtypes carry different epilepsy risks: <Cite slug="pubmed-39596993" />

| Subtype | Epilepsy Risk |
|---------|---------------|
| **Spastic diplegic** | Highest risk (OR = 1.88) |
| **Spastic quadriplegic** | Elevated risk |
| **Dyskinetic** | Elevated risk |
| **Hemiplegic** | Moderate risk |
| **Ataxic** | Lower risk |

**"Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy demonstrated the strongest correlation with seizure disorders."** <Cite slug="pubmed-39596993" />

### Other Risk Factors

- Perinatal infection (OR = 1.61) <Cite slug="pubmed-39596993" />
- Abnormal brain imaging <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" />
- More severe intellectual disability <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" />
- More severe neurological involvement <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" />

## Drug-Resistant Epilepsy

**22.4% of individuals with epilepsy and cerebral palsy have drug-resistant epilepsy**—meaning seizures are not controlled despite trying multiple medications. <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" />

Implications:
- May need specialist epilepsy center evaluation
- Consider alternative treatments (vagus nerve stimulation, surgery evaluation)
- Focus on seizure safety and quality of life
- Higher care burden for caregivers

## Medication Withdrawal Considerations

Attempting to stop seizure medications carries significant risk:

**"42.3% of the individuals who attempted antiseizure medication withdrawal experienced recurrence."** <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" />

Key findings:
- Nearly half experience seizure recurrence when attempting withdrawal
- EEG findings predict relapse risk <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" />
- Decisions should involve neurologist experienced with cerebral palsy
- Benefits of stopping (reduced side effects) must be weighed against recurrence risk

## Management Approach

### Initial Evaluation

1. **Confirm epilepsy diagnosis** - Not all movements in cerebral palsy are seizures
2. **EEG monitoring** - Helps characterize seizure type
3. **Brain imaging** - MRI to assess structural causes
4. **Review of all medications** - Interactions with cerebral palsy treatments

### Medication Selection

Considerations specific to cerebral palsy:
- Avoid medications that worsen spasticity (some may help it)
- Consider sedation effects in those with cognitive impairment
- Watch for bone density effects (many anticonvulsants reduce bone density)
- Account for swallowing difficulties (liquid vs. tablet formulations)
- Interactions with baclofen, botulinum toxin, and other cerebral palsy medications

### Specialist Team

| Specialist | Role |
|------------|------|
| **Neurologist** | Primary seizure management |
| **Physiatrist** | Coordinate with spasticity treatment |
| **Epileptologist** | Drug-resistant cases |
| **Pharmacist** | Medication interactions |

## Safety Considerations

For adults with cerebral palsy and epilepsy:
- **Supervision during bathing** - Drowning risk with seizures
- **Fall prevention** - Combined mobility issues and seizure risk
- **Medication adherence support** - Especially if cognitive impairment
- **Caregiver seizure training** - Recognition and response
- **Emergency medication access** - Rescue medications if prescribed

## Key Points

- About 51-56% of people with cerebral palsy have epilepsy <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" /> <Cite slug="pubmed-39596993" />
- Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy has the highest epilepsy risk <Cite slug="pubmed-39596993" />
- 22.4% have drug-resistant epilepsy <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" />
- Medication withdrawal leads to seizure recurrence in nearly half who attempt it <Cite slug="pubmed-37769423" />
- Management requires coordination between neurologist and physiatrist
- Cerebral palsy subtype and early medical history inform epilepsy risk <Cite slug="pubmed-39596993" />
