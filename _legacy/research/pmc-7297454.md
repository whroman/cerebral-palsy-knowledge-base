# Cerebral Palsy: Current Opinions on Definition, Epidemiology, and Classification

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7297454/)

## Key Findings

### Definition

> "Cerebral palsy is described as a heterogeneous group of motor disorders"

> "a group of neurological disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body movement and muscle coordination"

> "a motor disorder resulting from brain injury or abnormalities affecting the motor areas of the brain"

### Temporal Aspects

> "Some neurodevelopmental disorders in early life can be temporary, whereas progressive motor disorders, at least in the first period of disease, can have a similar clinical presentation to that of cerebral palsy"
