# Factors associated with caregiver burden among family caregivers of children with cerebral palsy: a systematic review

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10083783/)

## Key Findings

> "Depression of caregiver and severity of illness in children with cerebral palsy were moderate quality of evidence for factors contributing to caregiver burden"

> "Children with more severe disabilities require the more support of their caregivers"

### Primary Burden Factors

1. **Caregiver depression** - Strong association with increased burden
2. **Child severity** - More advanced physical disabilities correlate with heightened burden

### Additional Factors (Lower Evidence)
- Caregiver fatigue
- Caregiver anxiety
- Social support (insufficient data on effects)

### Study Details
- 16 cross-sectional studies
- 3,109 caregivers across 11 countries
- Caregivers predominantly mothers
- Studies from 2011-2022

### Implications
- Caregiver mental health directly affects burden
- More severe disability = more caregiver support needed
- Interventions targeting caregiver depression may reduce burden
