# Risk of Depression and Anxiety in Adults With Cerebral Palsy

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6439715/)

## Key Findings

> "Adults with cerebral palsy demonstrated significantly elevated hazard ratios for both depression (HR 1.28) and anxiety (HR 1.40) compared to matched controls"

> "The heightened risk applied specifically to individuals with cerebral palsy who lacked comorbid intellectual disability"

- Study design: Retrospective cohort using UK primary care data (1987-2015)
- Sample: 1,705 adults with cerebral palsy vs 5,115 matched controls
- Depression risk: HR 1.28 (elevated)
- Anxiety risk: HR 1.40 (elevated)
- Without intellectual disability: HR 1.44 depression, HR 1.55 anxiety
- With intellectual disability: similar rates to controls (possible diagnostic overshadowing)
- Absolute risk remained modest despite relative increases
