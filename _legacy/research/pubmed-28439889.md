# Prevalence and Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorders in Children with Cerebral Palsy

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28439889/)

## Key Findings

### Prevalence

> "Among children with cerebral palsy, 107 had an associated diagnosis of ASD - i.e., 8.7% of the study population (95% confidence interval 7.2-10.5). Variations between geographical areas ranged from 4.0% to 16.7%"

### Associated Factors

Children with cerebral palsy and ASD co-occurrence showed associations with:
- Male sex predominance
- Co-occurring epilepsy
- Intellectual disability
- Less severe motor impairment (better walking ability)
