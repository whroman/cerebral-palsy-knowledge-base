# Early, Accurate Diagnosis and Early Intervention in Cerebral Palsy: Advances in Diagnosis and Treatment

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28715518/)

## Key Findings

> "Cerebral palsy can now be diagnosed before 6 months corrected age"

> "Historically, the diagnosis of cerebral palsy was made between the ages of 12 to 24 months"

### Diagnostic Tools (Before 5 months corrected age)
- MRI: 86-89% sensitivity
- Prechtl Qualitative Assessment of General Movements: 98% sensitivity
- Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination: 90% sensitivity

### Diagnostic Tools (After 5 months corrected age)
- MRI: 86-89% sensitivity
- Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination: 90% sensitivity
- Developmental Assessment of Young Children: 83% C index

### Prognosis in High-Income Countries
- 2 in 3 will achieve walking ability
- 3 in 4 will develop speech
- 1 in 2 will have normal intelligence

### Benefits of Early Intervention

> "Prompt referral to diagnostic-specific early intervention optimizes infant motor and cognitive plasticity, prevents secondary complications, and enhances caregiver well-being"
