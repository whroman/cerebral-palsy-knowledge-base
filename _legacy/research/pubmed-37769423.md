# Risk factors and outcome of epilepsy in adults with cerebral palsy or intellectual disability

[Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37769423/)

## Key Findings

> "Epilepsy was present in 55.6% of the individuals"

> "Drug-resistant epilepsy occurred in 22.4% of cases"

> "42.3% of the individuals who attempted antiseizure medication withdrawal experienced recurrence"

> "Seizure recurrence after antiseizure medication withdrawal occurred in half"

- Retrospective analysis of 306 individuals with cerebral palsy or intellectual disability
- Epilepsy correlated with spastic cerebral palsy subtypes
- Increased intellectual disability severity associated with epilepsy
- Abnormal brain imaging associated with epilepsy
- Electroencephalogram findings serve as predictive marker for relapse risk after medication withdrawal
