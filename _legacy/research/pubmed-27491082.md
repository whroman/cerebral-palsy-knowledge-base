# Effectiveness of Rehabilitation Interventions to Improve Gait Speed in Children With Cerebral Palsy: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27491082/)

## Key Findings

### Study Scope
- 24 studies synthesized
- Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy
- Three intervention categories analyzed

### Gait Training (Most Effective)

> "Gait training was effective in increasing gait speed, with a standardized effect size of 0.92"

- Training without body-weight support: effect sizes 1.32–3.20
- Training with body-weight support: effect sizes −0.17 to 0.82
- Augmented feedback (pedometers, auditory-visual cues) enhanced outcomes

### Resistance Training (Ineffective)

> "Resistance training was shown to have a negligible effect" (effect size 0.06)

Despite muscle weakness correlating with reduced walking speed, even properly-dosed strength training failed to produce clinically meaningful gait improvements.

### Miscellaneous Interventions (Promising)
- EMG biofeedback training: significant improvements
- Whole-body vibration: significant improvements

### Key Conclusion
Task specificity and sensory feedback represent critical mechanisms for intervention success.
