# Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) Official Resource

[MACS Official Website](https://www.macs.nu/)

## Key Findings

### MACS Purpose

> "The Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) describes how children with cerebral palsy use their hands to handle objects in daily activities."

### Five Levels

> "MACS describes five levels. The levels are based on the children's self-initiated ability to handle objects and their need for assistance or adaptation to perform manual activities in everyday life."

### Key Distinction

> "The classification is designed to reflect the child's typical manual performance, not the child's maximal capacity. It classifies the collaborative use of both hands together."

### Mini-MACS

> "A version of the test for children under the age of four years old, the Mini-MACS, was developed in 2016."
