# Gait Training Reduces Ankle Joint Stiffness and Facilitates Heel Strike in Children with Cerebral Palsy

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25318785/)

## Key Findings

### Ankle Stiffness and Gait

> "Foot drop and toe walking are frequent concerns in children with cerebral palsy, with increased stiffness of the ankle joint muscles contributing to these problems"

### Developmental Milestones

> "Children usually demonstrate ankle dorsiflexion at heel strike by the age of five years"

### Treadmill Training Benefits

> "Daily intensive gait training may influence the elastic properties of ankle joint muscles and facilitate toe lift and heel strike in children with cerebral palsy, and may be beneficial in preventing contractures and maintaining gait ability"
