# Which gait training intervention can most effectively improve gait ability in patients with cerebral palsy? A systematic review and network meta-analysis

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9871496/)

## Key Findings

### Study Scope
- 20 randomized controlled trials
- 516 cerebral palsy patients
- Six intervention types compared

### Most Effective Interventions

**For Gait Velocity:**
- Partial body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT): 91.7% SUCRA ranking (most effective)
- External cues treadmill training (ECTT): 80.9% SUCRA ranking

> "BWSTT can reduce some of the patient's weight during gait training, reduce the load the patient has to overcome and ensure safety"

**For Gross Motor Function (GMFM):**
- Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT): 86.1% SUCRA ranking for walking-related measures (dimension E)

### Intervention Types Analyzed
1. Partial body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT)
2. Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT)
3. Treadmill training (TT)
4. External cues treadmill training (ECTT)
5. Over ground gait training (OGT)
6. Conventional physical therapy (CON)
