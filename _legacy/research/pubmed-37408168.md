# Comorbidities associated with 2-year mortality in adults with cerebral palsy in Japan

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37408168/)

## Key Findings

> "The model with aspiration pneumonia and pressure ulcers produced the best fit for predicting mortality"

> "Hazard risk of 2-year mortality for an unweighted WCI score of at least 4 was 2.56"

> "When cerebral palsy-specific comorbidities were included, the hazard ratio increased to 8.94"

### Study Population
- 2,232 adults with cerebral palsy in Japan
- 72 deaths during 2-year follow-up (3.2%)

### Key Mortality Predictors
1. **Aspiration pneumonia** - strongest predictor
2. **Pressure ulcers** - significant independent predictor
3. **Age** - independent risk factor
4. **Whitney Comorbidity Index score ≥4** - 2.56x hazard

### Clinical Implications
- Aspiration pneumonia prevention is critical
- Pressure ulcer prevention affects survival
- Comorbidity assessment should include cerebral palsy-specific factors
- Whitney Comorbidity Index useful but needs cerebral palsy additions

### Recommendations
- Screen for aspiration risk in all adults
- Aggressive pressure ulcer prevention
- Monitor comorbidity burden
- Use cerebral palsy-specific mortality prediction tools
