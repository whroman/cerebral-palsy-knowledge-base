# Gross Motor Function Classification System - Expanded and Revised (GMFCS-E&R)

[CanChild](https://canchild.ca/resources/42-gmfcs-e-r/)

## Key Findings

### GMFCS Purpose

The GMFCS classifies children and youth with cerebral palsy based on their self-initiated movement, with emphasis on sitting, transfers, and mobility.

### Five Levels

- **Level I**: Walks without limitations
- **Level II**: Walks with limitations
- **Level III**: Walks using a hand-held mobility device
- **Level IV**: Self-mobility with limitations; may use powered mobility
- **Level V**: Transported in a manual wheelchair

### Age Bands

The GMFCS-E&R includes descriptions for five age bands: before 2nd birthday, 2-4 years, 4-6 years, 6-12 years, and 12-18 years.

### Stability

GMFCS levels are generally stable over time, though some children may change levels, particularly during early childhood.
