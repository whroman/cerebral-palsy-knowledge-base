# Assessment of Adult Patients with Cerebral Palsy

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7756828/)

## Key Findings

### Study Population

> "A total of 70 adult cerebral palsy patients (37 males, 33 females; mean age 29.4±10.2 years; range, 19 to 68 years) who were admitted to clinic"

### Mental State

> "Half of our patients had poor mental state."

### Aging Concerns

> "Because children with cerebral palsy are often told that it is a non-progressive disease, they may be unprepared for the greater effects of the aging process as they head into their 30s. Young adults with cerebral palsy experience problems with aging that non-disabled adults experience 'much later in life'."
