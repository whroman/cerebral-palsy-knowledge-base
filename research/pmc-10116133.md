# Benefit of enteral baclofen in the management of spasticity in cerebral palsy

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10116133/)

## Key Findings

> "Although oral baclofen is not as effective for cerebral spasticity as it is for spinal spasticity, it remains commonly prescribed"

> "Side effect profile is manageable and easy to troubleshoot"

### Mechanism
- GABAB receptor agonist
- Reduces muscle spasticity
- Improves range of motion

### Clinical Benefits
- Decreases spasms
- Improves positioning
- Reduces pain
- Enhances caregiving ease
- Supports better brace fitting
- Prevents contracture formation

### Side Effects
