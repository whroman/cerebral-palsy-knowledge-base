# Cognitive Functioning and Assessment in Adults with Cerebral Palsy: A Scoping Review

[Taylor & Francis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17518423.2024.2347991)

## Key Findings

### Global Prevalence

> "17 million people globally have cerebral palsy"

### Cognitive Assessment Challenges

Adults with cerebral palsy face unique challenges in cognitive assessment due to:
- Motor impairments affecting test performance
- Communication difficulties
- Lack of age-appropriate standardized tools

### Need for Specialized Assessment

The review highlights the need for assessment approaches that account for the motor and communication challenges common in cerebral palsy.
