# Social Participation in Adults with Cerebral Palsy: A Systematic Review of the Evidence-Base

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37497638/)

## Key Findings

### Methodology

- Searched PubMed, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, Web of Science (December 2021-February 2022)
- 16 included studies (11 high quality, 5 medium quality)
- Participant numbers ranged from 7 to 335
- Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool for quality assessment
- Narrative synthesis

### Key Themes

#### 1. Environmental Factors
Both home and work settings significantly influence participation opportunities.

#### 2. Age-Appropriate Support
Support during childhood remains critical for adult participation outcomes.

#### 3. Limited Autonomy
Substantially constrains social engagement in adulthood.

### Core Finding

> Adults with cerebral palsy experience restricted social participation stemming from:
> - Inadequate childhood support
> - Lifespan physical limitations
> - Societal barriers
> - Inaccessible environments

### Implications

Improving participation requires:
- Better family support systems early in life
- Timely interventions
- Fostering independence throughout childhood

These strategies could enhance social participation throughout adulthood.
