Depending on individual needs, a patient may see a Primary Care doctor, a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation doctor (PMR), also known as a Physiatrist, a Neurologist, an Orthopedic Surgeon, and doctors specializing in other areas of medicine where needed"

### Treatment Options

> "They can seek help from a PMR or neurologist to discuss treatment options for pain and stiffness, including oral medication, botox injections, baclofen pumps, or rehabilitative therapy"
