# Functional Independence Measure

[Shirley Ryan AbilityLab](https://www.sralab.org/rehabilitation-measures/functional-independence-measure)

## Key Findings

### Validity

> "Content validity was established through a pilot study done at 11 centers with 110 patients evaluated. The concurrent validity with Barthel Index (ICC > 0.83) has shown strong construct validity between items on Barthel Index and items on the FIM."

### Clinical Utility

> "The FIM has consistently demonstrated good interrater reliability and validity, and is an excellent tool for detecting changes during rehabilitation; however, there is a ceiling effect that limits its utility for long-term follow-up."

### Limitations

> "The FIM does not contain key activity or participation elements of patient recovery important for measuring outcome and burden of illness (e.g., return to work, relationships, social and recreational pastimes)."
