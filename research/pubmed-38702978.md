# Cognitive Functioning and Assessment in Adults with Cerebral Palsy: A Scoping Review

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38702978/)

## Key Findings

### Variability in Cognition

> "The included studies show great variability in reported intelligence and cognitive functioning in adults with cerebral palsy, and cognitive deficits have been reported in all cognitive domains."

### Importance of Individual Assessment

> "For individuals with cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments may become more pronounced as the demands of life increase. For individuals with cerebral palsy, there is no one-to-one correlation between cognition and functioning in other areas, and therefore, cognition must be individually assessed to determine what targeted interventions are needed."

### Intellectual Disability Prevalence

> "Intellectual disability was diagnosed in 22.0%, similar to other studies where participants had a cognitive assessment, but lower than in studies where intellectual disability is registered not by psychologists, but by other professions"
