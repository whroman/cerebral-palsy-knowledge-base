# Autism and Cerebral Palsy: Converging Phenotypes

[Nature - Pediatric Research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-024-03575-9)

## Key Findings

### Screening Tool Limitations

> "The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised (M-CHAT-R), a common screening measure for ASD, showed that only 8% of early preterm children who screened positive were actually diagnosed with ASD at 11 years of age"

### Assessment Tool Limitations

> "The administration manual for the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2), widely considered the gold standard diagnostic assessment for ASD, states that it is not designed for use with children who have significant motor impairments"
