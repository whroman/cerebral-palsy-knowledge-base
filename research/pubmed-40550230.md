# Cerebral Palsy

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40550230/)

## Key Findings

> "Cerebral palsy is a lifelong physical disability affecting movement and posture"

> "95% of people with cerebral palsy have additional comorbidities, including pain and mental health conditions"

> "Up to 30% of individuals with cerebral palsy have a genetic contribution"

### Prevalence Trends
- High-income countries: 40% reduction in prevalence
- From 2.1 to 1.6 per 1,000 livebirths
- Prevalence remains higher in lower-income regions

### Key Advances
- Early diagnosis possible at 3 months
- New medical, regenerative, and rehabilitation therapies emerging
- Growing awareness of health challenges faced by adults
- Lifelong approach to care increasingly recognized

### Lifespan Considerations
- Physical decline faced by adults increasingly recognized
- Function and participation can be improved across lifespan
- Modern interventions improve outcomes at all ages

### Clinical Implications
- Comorbidity management is essential (95% affected)
- Early intervention improves outcomes
- Adult-specific care pathways needed
