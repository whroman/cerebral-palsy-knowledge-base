# Early Diagnosis and Classification of Cerebral Palsy: An Historical Perspective and Barriers to an Early Diagnosis

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6832653/)

## Key Findings

### Current Diagnosis Timing
> "Only 21% of Australian infants receive a cerebral palsy diagnosis by six months of age"

> "52% are diagnosed after one year"

> "In low-resource settings like Bangladesh, the average diagnosis age reaches five years"

### Historical Context
> "Since the 1800s, clinicians have advocated for early identification to enable timely intervention"

### Major Barriers to Early Diagnosis
1. Absence of definitive biomarkers for cerebral palsy
2. Difficulty applying the cerebral palsy definition to infants (ambiguous "activity limitations")
3. Concern about false positives and delayed diagnosis of alternative treatable conditions
4. Lack of curative treatments
5. Neurological signs of cerebral palsy often don't emerge until after six months

### Best Predictive Tools
- General Movements Assessment: 98% sensitivity, 91% specificity
- MRI at term-equivalent age: 86-100% sensitivity, 89-97% specificity

### Critical Recommendation
> "The authors advocate uncoupling diagnosis from classification in infants, allowing earlier diagnosis before motor type characteristics fully manifest"
