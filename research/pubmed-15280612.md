# Evaluation of a child with cerebral palsy

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15280612/)

## Key Findings

### Multidisciplinary Team Composition

> "Evaluation of a child with cerebral palsy requires a multidisciplinary approach with a team of professionals comprising of a pediatrician or pediatric neurologist, occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, child psychologist, and a social worker"

### Assessment Dimensions
- Diagnostic confirmation and cause determination through clinical diagnosis
- Motor function assessment and identification of associated problems
- Medical screening focusing on common childhood conditions, particularly nutritional disorders
- Family functioning evaluation
- Routine vision and hearing assessments

### Ongoing Nature

> "Cerebral palsy is a changing disorder"

Assessment is an ongoing process throughout development, as limitations may emerge later in childhood or adolescence.
