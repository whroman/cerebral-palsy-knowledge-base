# The Reliability of the Functional Independence Measure: A Quantitative Review

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8976303/)

## Key Findings

### Overall Reliability

> "The FIM has demonstrated acceptable reliability across a wide variety of settings, raters, and patients, with median interrater reliability for the total FIM of 0.95 and median test-retest and equivalence reliability values of 0.95 and 0.92, respectively."

### Subscale Reliability

> "The median reliability values for the six FIM subscales ranged from 0.95 for Self-Care to 0.78 for Social Cognition, and for individual FIM items, median reliability values varied from 0.90 for Toilet Transfer to 0.61 for Comprehension."

### Motor vs Cognitive Items

> "Median and mean reliability coefficients for FIM motor items were generally higher than for items in the cognitive or communication subscales. The FIM showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.98 for total FIM, 0.95 and 0.89 for FIM Motor and FIM Cognitive, respectively)."
