# The Rehabilitation Interventions and Adaptive Technologies Used for Treating Patients With Cerebral Palsy

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10733710/)

## Key Findings

### Orthotic Interventions

> "Ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) reduce energy expenditure during ambulation and prevent joint deformities"

- Orthoses restore muscle power and reduce energy required to walk
- Provide adequate support to limbs
- Beneficial outcomes observed more in sagittal plane
- User comfort remains a challenge

### Robotic-Assisted Devices

- Technologies like Lokomat enable high-intensity, task-specific training
- Provide "correct motor coordination of muscles"
- Improve patient motivation through engaging interventions

### Other Interventions

- Resistance training ~3x weekly enhances motor development
- Kinesiology taping improves upper limb function and joint mobility
- Botulinum toxin reduces spasticity for 5-6 months
- Multidisciplinary team involvement essential
