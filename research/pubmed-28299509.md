# Symptom Recognition and Diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy in Nepal

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28299509/)

## Key Findings

> "Parents recognized the symptoms of cerebral palsy at mean age of 13 months"

> "There was a mean delay of 23 months between symptom recognition and seeking medical help"

> "The mean age of diagnosis was 5½ years"

### Contributing Factors
- Less than half of affected children received care from pediatricians
- Inadequate awareness
- Limited access to appropriate medical services
- Culturally-rooted misconceptions about the condition

Note: This study is from Nepal (low-resource setting). Diagnosis delays are typically shorter in high-income countries but still significant.
