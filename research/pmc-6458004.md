# Interventions for Idiopathic Toe Walking

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6458004/)

## Key Findings

### Serial Casting

> "Serial casting is a nonoperative technique for stretching the Achilles tendon, where the child is placed in a below-the-knee cast while the knee is flexed and foot is dorsiflexed"

### Orthotic Devices

> "An ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) or serial casting promotes progressive stretching of naturally shortening tissues"

### Benefits of AFOs

- Maintain stretch throughout the day
- Provide stability during walking
- Prevent progression of contractures
- Improve gait efficiency
