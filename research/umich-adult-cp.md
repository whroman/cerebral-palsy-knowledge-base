# Adult Cerebral Palsy Care

[University of Michigan Health](https://www.uofmhealth.org/conditions-treatments/rehabilitation/adult-cerebral-palsy-care)

## Key Findings

### Initial Evaluation

> "During an appointment, body weight and other measurements are recorded, and the patient's medications are reviewed. A PM&R specialist performs an evaluation and, if necessary, helps coordinate referrals to other service providers"

> "At your first visit, our physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists will help you figure out what's going on in your body. At your appointments, your provider will talk with you about each of your symptoms and do a physical examination. They might order tests like X-rays or a bone scan"

### Multidisciplinary Approach

> "Working closely with colleagues in cardiology, pulmonology, orthopedics, nutrition, speech-language therapy, and our Wheelchair and Durable Medical Equipment Clinic, we help patients access advanced treatments to optimize their overall health and reduce the impact of changing symptoms on daily life"

> "Care in the Adult Cerebral Palsy Clinic is overseen by specialists in physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R). Since each patient's needs are unique, PM&R specialists can collaborate with any of following specialists as needed"

### Research Leadership

> "Clinicians in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation are leading studies about quality of life and health outcomes in teens and adults with cerebral palsy"

### Early Detection

> "Taking note of your changing symptoms and diagnosing new problems means you can get treatment sooner"
