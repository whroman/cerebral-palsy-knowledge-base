# Self-Concept of Adults with Cerebral Palsy

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20804447/)

## Key Findings

### Methodology

- 102 adults with cerebral palsy (52 female, mean age 26)
- 38 excluded for unreliable validity scale responses
- 64 analyzed

### Assessment Tools

- Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, version 2
- Functional Independence Measure (FIM)
- Beck Depression Index II
- Craig Hospital Inventory of Environmental Factors
- Diener's Satisfaction with Life Scale
- GMFCS levels

### Self-Concept Distribution

| Level | Number |
|-------|--------|
| High self-concept | 10 |
| Average self-concept | 41 |
| Low self-concept | 13 |

### Critical Finding

> "Self-concept had a fair and inverse association with depression (BDI-II) and a moderate and direct association with life satisfaction."

**Self-concept was unrelated to:**
- Cerebral palsy severity
- Motor function level
- GMFCS classification

**Self-concept was associated with:**
- Depression levels (inverse)
- Life satisfaction (positive)

### Domains Most Affected

Family and personal relationship domains scored lowest for those with low self-concept.

### Clinical Implications

> "Family centred care into adulthood" is recommended for adults with cerebral palsy.
