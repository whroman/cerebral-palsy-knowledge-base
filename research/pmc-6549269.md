# Survival and mortality in cerebral palsy: observations to the sixth decade from a data linkage study of a total population register and National Death Index

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6549269/)

## Key Findings

> "For 22% of individuals with cerebral palsy with mild impairment survival to 58 years is similar to that of the general population"

> "More than 80% have a life expectancy beyond 58 years"

> "58.6% of deaths were attributed to respiratory causes, including 49% to pneumonia"

### Study Population
- 3,185 individuals with cerebral palsy born in Western Australia (1956-2011)
- 436 (13.7%) died by December 2014
- Tracked to sixth decade of life

### Survival by Severity
- Mild impairment (22%): survival similar to general population through age 58
- Moderate impairment: reduced but substantial survival
- Severe impairment: 50% mortality by age 15-22 years depending on severity level

### Cause of Death
- 58.6% respiratory causes
- 49% pneumonia
- Nearly half involved aspiration

### Temporal Trends
- Early childhood mortality in severe cases decreased for 1990s-2000s births
- Majority with severe impairment now reach adulthood
- Mortality has shifted from childhood to early adulthood
