# Child and Youth Experiences and Perspectives of Cerebral Palsy: A Qualitative Systematic Review

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26754030/)

## Key Findings

### Methodology

- Systematic review of qualitative studies
- 33 articles involving 390 youth aged 2-25 years
- Studies from six countries
- Searched 1980-September 2014
- Organized using ICF framework

### Key Themes (ICF Framework)

#### 1. Social and Environmental Factors
> "Social inclusion and the physical environment (i.e. services and supports, transportation, accessibility, accommodations, safety and weather)"

#### 2. Relationships
Role of family and peers in participation across leisure, school, and civic engagement.

#### 3. Body Function
> "Pain and physical functioning, mental health, fatigue and unpredictability of body function"

#### 4. Personal Factors
Independence, coping strategies, and body image.

### Resilience and Identity

Youth experienced disruptions to their life trajectories through physical limitations, yet demonstrated resilience.

> Youth "had strategies to revise their biographies to maintain personal and social normalcy"

They balanced the reality of their condition with efforts to preserve typical youth identity and participation.

### Research Gaps

Limited research focus on:
- Mobility aids
- Daily activities
- Assistive device experiences
