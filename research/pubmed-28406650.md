# Disability Identity Development: A Systematic Review of the Literature

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28406650/)

## Key Findings

> "Disability identity can be considered a unique phenomenon that shapes persons' ways of seeing themselves, their bodies, and their way of interacting with the world."

> "Identity development is a fundamentally social process."

### Methodology

- Searched EBSCO, PsycINFO, ERIC, Sociological Abstracts (1980-2017)
- 41 articles met inclusion criteria
- 75.6% qualitative studies, 22% quantitative, 1 mixed-methods

### Identity Formation Mechanisms

Identity develops through:
- **Mirroring** - seeing oneself reflected in others' responses
- **Modeling** - observing others with disabilities
- **Recognition** - through available identity resources

### Clinical Implications

> "Professionals (therapists, teachers, caregivers) should understand this process to better support individuals."

The review emphasizes that disability identity development has the potential to become an important factor in developing effective interventions and therapies.
