# The Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) for Children with Cerebral Palsy: Scale Development and Evidence of Validity and Reliability

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16780622/)

## Key Findings

### MACS Purpose

The MACS classifies how children with cerebral palsy use their hands to handle objects in daily activities.

### Five Levels

- **Level I**: Handles objects easily and successfully
- **Level II**: Handles most objects but with somewhat reduced quality or speed
- **Level III**: Handles objects with difficulty; needs help to prepare or modify activities
- **Level IV**: Handles a limited selection of easily managed objects in adapted situations
- **Level V**: Does not handle objects and has severely limited ability to perform even simple actions

### Validation

The scale demonstrates good validity and reliability for classifying manual ability in children with cerebral palsy.
