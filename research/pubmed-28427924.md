# Long-Term Deterioration of Perceived Health and Functioning in Adults With Cerebral Palsy

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28427924/)

## Key Findings

### Methodology

- Prospective cohort study
- 49 adults aged 35-45 years (55% male, 75% spastic type)
- 10-14 year follow-up period
- Postal questionnaires measuring health perception, Barthel Index, walking performance

### Health Perception Deterioration

| Measure | Baseline | Follow-up | p-value |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Worried about health | 29% | 54% | .008 |
| Health limits activities | 19% | 45% | .002 |

### Functional Decline

> "Mobility and self-care deteriorated"

- Barthel scores: 17.1±4.8 → 16.3±5.6 (p=.007)
- Indoor walking: 83% → 71% (p=.010)
- 32% experienced severe fatigue at follow-up

### Common Complications

Pain and severe fatigue emerged as the most prevalent health issues in adults with cerebral palsy.

### Clinical Implications

> "Systematic follow-up of adults with cerebral palsy appears necessary"

Early detection and intervention for progressive health problems is essential.
