# Emerging Issues in Cerebral Palsy Associated With Aging: A Physiatrist Perspective

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6637058/)

## Key Findings

### Growing Population

The adult cerebral palsy population in the US increased from approximately 400,000 in 1995 to over 1,000,000 currently due to improved medical care and extended life expectancy.

### Cardiometabolic Challenges

Adults with cerebral palsy experience higher rates of chronic conditions:
- Diabetes
- Hypertension
- Cardiovascular disease
- Metabolic syndrome: 20.5% (ambulatory) to 28.6% (non-ambulatory)

### Physical Deterioration Timeline

> "Adolescents with cerebral palsy gradually exhibit a progressive decline in strength and functional reserve through adult life."

- Most noticeable decrements: late 20s and early 30s
- Ambulatory function typically declines after age 35

### Musculoskeletal Complications

- Sarcopenia and osteoporosis are prevalent
- Vitamin D deficiency: >50% of adults with cerebral palsy
- Fragility fractures increase significantly with age

### Swallowing Dysfunction

Gradual deterioration in swallowing capabilities begins as early as age 30, with aspiration risks increasing despite maintained dietary patterns from childhood.

### Chronic Pain

75% prevalence of persistent chronic pain in adults with cerebral palsy.

### Healthcare Access Gaps

In South Korea:
- Only 53.2% underwent medical check-ups within two years
- Only 37% received rehabilitation therapy
