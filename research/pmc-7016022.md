# Clinical and functional outcomes of total hip arthroplasty in patients with cerebral palsy: A systematic review

[Source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7016022/)

## Key Findings

> "Pain levels were reported by patients, family members or care givers with one study achieving 87% pain relief"

> "Improved function, improved hygienic care, with one cohort reporting 79% functional improvement post-surgery"

> "Reported survivorship ranged from 81-95% at 10-15 year follow-up"

> "93.6% 5 year implant survival in the cerebral palsy population"

- Systematic review of 9 articles (7 case series, 2 retrospective case-control)
- Studies published 1986-2017, 10-389 patients per study
- Average follow-up 3.3-10 years
- Significant pain relief achieved in most patients
- Functional improvement including hygienic care
- Recurrent hip dislocation and periprosthetic fractures are primary concerns
- Revision rates varied 0-26%
- Long-term implant survival comparable to standard populations
- Total hip arthroplasty is viable treatment option for adults with cerebral palsy
