# Intrathecal baclofen efficacy for managing motor function and spasticity severity in patients with cerebral palsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38678195/)

## Key Findings

> "Average spasticity scores decreased from 3.2 to 1.9, representing a 40.25% reduction"

> "The Gross Motor Function Measure showed modest gains, with scores improving from 40.03 to 43.88—approximately a 9.62% increase"

- Spasticity analysis: 19 studies, 343 patients (mean age 15.78 years)
- Motor function analysis: 6 studies, 117 patients
- Spasticity reduction: 40.25% (scores 3.2 → 1.9)
- Motor function improvement: 9.62% (GMFM 40.03 → 43.88)
- Complications: 203 of 501 implantations
  - Infections: 16.26%
  - Meningitis: 3.94%
  - Catheter problems: 75 cases
- Conclusion: Significant spasticity reduction with modest motor gains despite complication risks
