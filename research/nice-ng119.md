# Cerebral palsy in adults (NICE guideline NG119)

[NICE Guideline](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng119)

## Key Recommendations

### Assessment of Vocational and Living Skills

> "Adults with cerebral palsy should be given information about assessments of vocational and independent living skills that is tailored to the person's functional abilities and goals."

### Bone and Joint Health

> "NICE recommends considering assessment for risk of fractures secondary to osteoporosis in adults with cerebral palsy, with risk factors including needing help with moving or having to be moved."

> "A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) assessment should be considered in adults with cerebral palsy who have 2 or more risk factors, particularly if they have had a previous low-impact fracture."

### Communication

> "Adults with cerebral palsy who have communication difficulties should be referred to speech and language therapy services to assess their need for intervention, which may include use of alternative or augmentative communication systems or intensive speech therapy."

### Mental Health

> "Mental health problems should be identified and addressed alongside physical health problems."

### Care and Support

> "Adults with cerebral palsy and their families should be explained their right to a care and support needs assessment, in line with the Care Act 2014."

### Specialist Team

> "Service providers should ensure they have a specialist multidisciplinary team with expertise in neurodisabilities, with systems in place to assess the needs of adults with cerebral palsy and their ability to carry out daily activities."
