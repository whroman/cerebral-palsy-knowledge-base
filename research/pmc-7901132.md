# Oral Muscle Relaxants for the Treatment of Chronic Pain Associated with Cerebral Palsy

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7901132/)

## Key Findings

> "62% of patients experience chronic muscular pain"

> "The American Academy of Neurology states there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of oral baclofen for cerebral palsy spasticity"

### Medications Reviewed

**Baclofen:**
- Mixed evidence despite decades of use
- GABAB receptor agonist
- Side effects: drowsiness, constipation, tolerance in 3-20%

**Dantrolene:**
- Limited recent evidence (most from 1980s)
- Adherence challenges due to complex dosing

**Diazepam:**
- Effective for short-term spasticity control
- Works comparably to baclofen
- Best for severely affected patients

**Tizanidine:**
- Promising results in small studies
- Potentially superior to baclofen when combined with botulinum toxin
- Fewer muscle weakness side effects

**Cyclobenzaprine:**
- Not FDA-approved for cerebral palsy spasticity
- Higher CNS depression risk
