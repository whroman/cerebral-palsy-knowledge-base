# Adults with Cerebral Palsy and Functional Decline: A Cross-sectional Analysis from the CPRN Community Registry

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38433033/)

## Key Findings

### Methodology

- Cross-sectional analysis of CPRN Community Registry
- 263 respondents (76% female, mean age 42 years)
- Patient-reported outcomes on functional changes since childhood

### Gross Motor Decline

> "Many reported functional changes, most commonly a decline in gross motor function since childhood (n = 158, 60%)"

| Cerebral Palsy Type | Gross Motor Decline |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Spastic | 60.7% (108/178) |
| All types combined | 60% |

### Age Correlation

> "All decline types increased with age" with "statistically significant differences between age groups"

Functional decline across all domains increases with advancing age.

### Decline by Domain

- Gross motor decline varied significantly by severity level
- Hand function decline showed no significant variation by severity
- Communication decline showed no significant variation by severity

### Clinical Implications

> Need for "risk stratification and preventive and rehabilitative measures" to address functional decline across the lifespan.
