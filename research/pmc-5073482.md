# Ageing with Cerebral Palsy: What Are the Health Experiences of Adults with Cerebral Palsy? A Qualitative Study

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5073482/)

## Key Findings

### Methodology

- Qualitative descriptive approach
- Semi-structured interviews with 28 adults (aged 37-70) in New Zealand
- Thematic analysis using NVivo software

### Five Major Themes

#### 1. Acceptance of Change
Recognition that physical aging occurs earlier with cerebral palsy. Participants adapted through modified routines, rest scheduling, and equipment use.

#### 2. Exploring Identity: Cerebral Palsy as One Part of Self

> "I don't know how to bridge that gap between 'this is who I am' and 'this is me with cerebral palsy.'"

Central tension between disabled and non-disabled identities. Participants noted social attitudes and stigma proved more disabling than the condition itself.

#### 3. Taking Charge of Help

> "I need some things done for me but that's different from 'I need to be taken care of.'"

Participants valued autonomy in receiving assistance.

#### 4. Rethinking the Future
Managing uncertainty about progressive physical changes through proactive strategies including goal-setting and information-seeking.

#### 5. Interacting with Health Professionals
- **Positive encounters**: Professionals who listened, respected lived experience, demonstrated willingness to learn
- **Negative experiences**: Providers focused solely on disability rather than the whole person

### Common Thread

A growing awareness that physical resources were limited. Participants described increased fatigue, diminishing energy, and general slowing down occurring at earlier ages than non-disabled peers.
