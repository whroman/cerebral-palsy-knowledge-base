# Epilepsy in Cerebral Palsy: Unraveling Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Subtype Associations in a Large-Scale Population Study

[Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39596993/)

## Key Findings

> "Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy demonstrated the strongest correlation with seizure disorders, with adjusted OR = 1.88, 95% CI [1.73-2.04], p < 0.0001"

> "Perinatal infection emerged as a significant contributing factor, showing adjusted OR = 1.61, 95% CI [1.17-2.23], p = 0.004"

> "Specific cerebral palsy subtypes and perinatal factors play pivotal roles in epilepsy risk"

- Large-scale analysis of 88,138 cerebral palsy patients
- 44,901 patients with epilepsy (51%)
- 43,237 patients without epilepsy
- Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy has strongest association with epilepsy
- Perinatal infection is a significant risk factor
- Tailored clinical approaches based on cerebral palsy type and early medical history recommended
