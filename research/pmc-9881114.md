# Innovations of ICD-11 in Autism Spectrum Disorder

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9881114/)

## Key Findings

### ICD-11 Classification of ASD

> "The ICD-11 endorses a medical model, conceptualising Autism Spectrum Disorder as a medical condition with an inborn, for a substantial part, genetically inherited nature, while acknowledging that gene-environment interactions also play a pivotal role in neurodevelopment (classifying this category in the over-arching category of Neurodevelopmental Disorders)"
