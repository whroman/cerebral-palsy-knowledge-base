# Survival of individuals with cerebral palsy in Victoria, Australia: A longitudinal cohort study spanning four decades

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36161450/)

## Key Findings

> "35% improvement in the probability of survival to 15 years for births in the 2000s relative to the 1970s"

> "Children aged 1-15 years experiencing mortality rates 45-62 times higher than their peers"

> "90% survival to 18 years... reduced to 66% for persons with complex cerebral palsy"

### Study Population
- 4,807 individuals with cerebral palsy
- Born in Victoria, Australia 1970-2012
- 2,716 males (56.5%), 2,091 females (43.5%)
- Median follow-up: 21 years 4 months
- Total: 108,156 person-years

### Mortality Data
- 666 deaths (13.9%)
- 36 deaths within first year of life
- Mortality strongly associated with:
  - Degree of motor impairment
  - Epilepsy
  - Intellectual disability
  - Bilateral deafness
  - Blindness

### Survival Trends
- Overall improvement in survival for those born 2000s vs 1970s
- Improvement mainly due to proportional reduction in complex cerebral palsy
- Children with complex cerebral palsy: only 4% improvement in survival
- Persistent disparities by disease severity

### Key Conclusions
- Survival has improved, but mainly through prevention of severe cases
- Treatment outcomes for severe cases show minimal gains
- Complex cerebral palsy continues to carry high mortality risk
