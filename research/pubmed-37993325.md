# Adults with cerebral palsy and chronic pain experience: A cross-sectional analysis of patient-reported outcomes from a novel North American registry

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37993325/)

## Key Findings

> "Back and weight-bearing joints of lower extremities were most frequently reported as painful"

> "Those with moderate-to-severe pain showed increased depression, reduced social role satisfaction, and lower extremity function decline"

- Sample: 149 adults with cerebral palsy reporting chronic pain (75% female; mean age 43 years)
- Pain locations: back and weight-bearing joints most common
- Pain interference positively correlated with depression
- Pain interference negatively correlated with physical function and social participation
- Nonpharmacologic interventions most commonly cited as beneficial
- No significant pain severity differences across GMFCS levels or age groups
