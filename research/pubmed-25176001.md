# Negotiating Identity: A Qualitative Analysis of Stigma and Support Seeking for Individuals with Cerebral Palsy

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25176001/)

## Key Findings

> "Stigma can complicate identity. In this domain, people with cerebral palsy face a number of threats in how they construe their identity, both in navigating stigma and maintaining access to needed support."

### Methodology

- Online survey of 28 adults with cerebral palsy
- Examined personal identity construction, social identity, and stigma experiences during support-seeking

### Identity Tension

The study identified a critical tension:

| Identity Emphasis | Benefit | Cost |
|-------------------|---------|------|
| **Personal identity** (unique individual) | Receiving individualized support | Support eligibility questioned |
| **Social identity** (disabled group member) | Access to support, coping with stigma | Stigmatization through feelings of difference |

### Key Statistics

- Majority sought support to manage cerebral palsy
- Half experienced stigma in support-seeking settings
- Participants valued both personal and social identity constructions
- Identity construction varied by context depending on support needs

### Clinical Implications

Healthcare providers should:
- Tailor services individually
- Encourage patient engagement with online disability support groups
- Facilitate meaningful social connections
