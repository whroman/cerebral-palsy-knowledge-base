# Differentiating Between Idiopathic Toe Walking and Cerebral Palsy: A Systematic Review

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31842091/)

## Key Findings

### Toe Walking Definition

Toe walking is characterized by the lack of heel strike at the initial contact phase of the gait cycle, with an absence of normal heel-to-floor contact. The forefoot engages in the majority of floor contact throughout the gait cycle.

### Diagnostic Framework

> "Accurate differentiation between cerebral palsy and idiopathic toe walking requires systematic assessment using evidence-based tests and measures in accordance with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model"

### Clinical Importance

Distinguishing between idiopathic toe walking and cerebral palsy is critical for:
- Appropriate treatment planning
- Accurate prognosis
- Avoiding misdiagnosis
