# Physical activity and exercise interventions in adults with cerebral palsy: a systematic review of quantitative and qualitative studies

[Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39180329/)

## Key Findings

> "Walking speed: No significant improvement in 10-meter walking speed (SMD = -0.03, p = 0.88)"

> "Endurance: No improvement in distance covered during 2 or 6-minute tests (SMD = 0.25, p = 0.16)"

> "Muscle strength: Demonstrated improvement in lower limb strength favoring intervention groups (SMD = 0.59, p = 0.004)"

> "Enjoyment and confidence are key themes associated with a positive experience of physical activity participation"

- Meta-analysis of 22 studies on exercise/physical activity for adults with cerebral palsy
- Lower limb muscle strength improved significantly with intervention
- Walking speed and endurance did not show significant improvement
- Psychosocial outcomes (enjoyment, confidence) are important for long-term sustainability
- Rehabilitation approaches should address psychosocial outcomes alongside physical measures
