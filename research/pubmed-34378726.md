# Effectiveness and Determinant Variables of Augmentative and Alternative Communication Interventions in Cerebral Palsy Patients with Communication Deficit: a Systematic Review

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34378726/)

## Key Findings

> "Moderate-quality evidence that AAC interventions improve the receptive and expressive communication skills in patients with cerebral palsy"

> "High-quality evidence that AAC is improving communication at medium and long-term interventions when compared to speech therapy or no therapy"

> "Diversity of cerebral palsy patients requires proper analysis of determinant variables to ensure the efficacy of AAC assessment and intervention"

### Study Details
- 9 eligible studies identified
- 294 total participants
- Searched 9 major medical databases

### Evidence Quality
- Moderate-quality evidence for communication improvement
- High-quality evidence when comparing AAC to speech therapy alone
- More high-quality studies needed

### Key Variables
- Individual patient characteristics matter
- Proper assessment crucial for intervention success
- Personalized approach needed

### Outcomes
- Improved receptive language
- Improved expressive language
- Medium and long-term efficacy demonstrated
