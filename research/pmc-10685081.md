[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10685081/)

## Key Findings

### Major Assessment Scales
- **GMFCS**: Classifies individuals into five levels based on mobility and walking independence
- **MACS**: Evaluates hand function and manual dexterity across five levels
- **CFCS**: Assesses communication abilities across five levels
- **Additional tools**: PEDI, WeeFIM, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Bayley Scales

### Multidisciplinary Team Approach

> "Collaboration among healthcare professionals, including neurologists, orthopedic surgeons, therapists, psychologists, and educators, is essential for comprehensive CP assessments"

> "A multidisciplinary approach ensures that assessments encompass all relevant domains, including motor function, communication, cognition, and psychosocial well-being"

### Holistic Assessment
Collaborative teams provide a holistic understanding of an individual's needs and design comprehensive care plans addressing all aspects of living with cerebral palsy.
