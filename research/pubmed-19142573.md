# Effectiveness of botulinum toxin A for upper and lower limb spasticity in children with cerebral palsy: a summary of evidence

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19142573/)

## Key Findings

### Upper Limb Spasticity
- 6 RCTs analyzed (229 children; 115 received BTX-A)
- 5 of 6 trials showed time-limited decrease in muscle tone at wrist
- Only 4 trials demonstrated improved hand function
- Evidence rated as "insufficient and inconsistent"

### Lower Limb Spasticity
- 13 trials analyzed (617 children; 360 received BTX-A)
- Stronger evidence than upper limb

> "Three Class I trials documented significant improvement in gait pattern in children with gastrocnemius spasticity"

> "BoNT-A as an effective treatment for equinovarus deformity"

### Safety Profile

> "Adverse events in these trials were mild and self-limited. The most common complaints were pain in the injection sites and transient weakness"

### Conclusion
Growing convincing evidence for time-limited beneficial effect in reducing muscle tone, with documented functional gait improvements for lower limbs.
