# A Systematic Review of the Self-Concept of Children with Cerebral Palsy Compared with Children Without Disability

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16417673/)

## Key Findings

### Methodology

- Searched electronic databases with citation tracking
- 1,355 papers initially identified
- 6 met inclusion criteria for final analysis

### Critical Finding

> "There was insufficient evidence to conclude that children with cerebral palsy, in general, have a lower global self-concept compared with those without disability."

However, the data revealed important subgroup differences.

### Adolescent Females: At-Risk Group

Adolescent girls with cerebral palsy showed significantly lower self-concept than non-disabled peers in four domains:

| Domain | Effect Size (d) |
|--------|-----------------|
| Physical appearance | -1.16 |
| Social acceptance | -1.24 |
| Athletic competence | -0.93 |
| Scholastic competence | -0.86 |

### Clinical Implications

> "Adolescent females with cerebral palsy may be an at-risk group owing to their vulnerable self-concept."

This population warrants clinical monitoring and targeted intervention strategies.
