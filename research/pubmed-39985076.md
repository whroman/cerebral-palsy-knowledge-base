# Swallowing disorders in cerebral palsy: a systematic review of oropharyngeal dysphagia, nutritional impact, and health risks

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39985076/)

## Key Findings

> "81.5% of kids with cerebral palsy suffer from dysphagia"

> "Swallowing disorders can affect up to 85% of children with cerebral palsy"

> "Gastroesophageal symptoms causing malnutrition and growth delays require personalized interventions"

### Prevalence
- Dysphagia affects up to 85% of individuals with cerebral palsy
- One study found 100% of students at a special needs school showed signs of oropharyngeal dysphagia
- 90.6% experienced compromised swallowing safety

### Consequences
- Malnutrition
- Growth delays
- Microaspiration
- Recurrent respiratory infections
- Dehydration

### Assessment
- Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) identified as primary evaluation tool
- Methodological inconsistencies limit assessment standardization
- Need for standardized evaluation methods

### Recommendations
- Personalized interventions required
- Early screening regardless of motor impairment level
- Multidisciplinary approach needed
