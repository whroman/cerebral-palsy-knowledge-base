# Developing and Validating the Communication Function Classification System for Individuals with Cerebral Palsy

[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21707596/)

## Key Findings

### CFCS Purpose

> "The Communication Function Classification System (CFCS) was created and validated for children with cerebral palsy that can be used by a wide variety of individuals who are interested in cerebral palsy."

### Development and Validation

> "An 11-member development team created comprehensive descriptions of the CFCS levels, and four nominal groups comprising 27 participants critiqued these levels. Within a Delphi survey, 112 participants commented on the clarity and usefulness of the CFCS. Interrater reliability was completed by 61 professionals and 68 parents/relatives who classified 69 children with cerebral palsy aged 2 to 18 years."

> "The CFCS demonstrates content validity and shows very good test-retest reliability, good professional interrater reliability, and moderate parent-professional interrater reliability."

### Five Levels

- **Level I**: Child with cerebral palsy is an effective sender and receiver with unfamiliar and familiar partners
- **Level II**: Child with cerebral palsy is an effective but slower paced sender and/or receiver with unfamiliar and familiar partners
- **Level III**: Child with cerebral palsy is an effective sender and receiver with familiar partners
- **Level IV**: Child with cerebral palsy is sometimes an effective sender and receiver with familiar partners
- **Level V**: Child with cerebral palsy is seldom an effective sender and receiver even with familiar partners

### Integration with Other Classification Systems

> "Combining the CFCS with the Gross Motor Function Classification System and the Manual Ability Classification System contributes to a functional performance view of daily life for individuals with cerebral palsy, in accordance with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health."

### Key Distinction

The CFCS focuses on communication function regardless of the method used (speech, gestures, AAC devices).
