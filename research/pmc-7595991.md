# Autism Spectrum Disorder and ADHD Screening in Children with Cerebral Palsy

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7595991/)

## Key Findings

### Under-diagnosis

> "One third (74/213) of children screened positive for ASD and half of the children (106/213) for ADHD, which was about twice as often as ASD/ADHD diagnoses had been clinically identified"

### Associated Factors

> "Children with intellectual disability, epilepsy and/or impaired speech ability more often screened positive for ASD as well as ADHD. Severe motor impairment was more frequently associated with screen-positive ASD"
