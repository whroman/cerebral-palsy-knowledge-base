# Risk Factors for Mortality in Patients With Cerebral Palsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

[PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10292172/)

## Key Findings

> "Multiple factors predict the risk of mortality in patients with cerebral palsy. Pneumonia and other respiratory infections are associated with a high risk of mortality."

> "Aspiration as linked with oropharyngeal dysfunction, resulting in pneumonia as a critical factor"

### Study Details
- 9 primary studies included
- 10,837 total patients with cerebral palsy
- 1,448 deaths recorded (13.36% mortality rate)
- Search period: 2000-2023
- Quality: 7 moderate-quality, 2 high-quality studies (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale)

### Mortality Risk Factors (by statistical significance)

| Risk Factor | Odds Ratio | 95% CI |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Accidents** | 0.05 | 0.04-0.07 |
| **Neurological disorders & sepsis** | 0.11 | 0.08-0.16 |
| **Cardiovascular/circulatory diseases** | 0.11 | 0.04-0.27 |
| **Gastrointestinal/metabolic causes** | 0.12 | 0.06-0.22 |
| **Respiratory infections** | 0.36 | 0.31-0.51 |
| **Pneumonia** | 0.40 | 0.31-0.51 |

### Key Conclusions
- Respiratory complications are the most common cause of mortality
- Aspiration pneumonia is a critical preventable factor
- Cardiovascular disease is significantly elevated
- Proper preventive measures can reduce mortality risk
