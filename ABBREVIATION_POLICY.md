# Abbreviation Policy for Cerebral Palsy Knowledge Base

## Critical Policy

**This knowledge base does NOT use abbreviations for medical conditions**, particularly "CP" for cerebral palsy.

## Rationale

1. **Safety Concern**: The abbreviation "CP" has an extremely dangerous alternate meaning on the internet related to illegal content. Using this abbreviation in online spaces can:
   - Trigger unwanted algorithmic attention
   - Create serious misunderstandings
   - Cause discomfort for families searching for medical information

2. **Clarity**: Spelling out "cerebral palsy" ensures absolute clarity for all readers, including:
   - Family members new to the diagnosis
   - Non-medical professionals
   - International readers where abbreviations may differ

3. **Accessibility**: Full terms are more accessible for:
   - Screen readers
   - Translation software
   - Search engine optimization

## Guidelines

### DO:
- Always write "cerebral palsy" in full
- Spell out other medical conditions on first use
- Use clear, descriptive language

### DO NOT:
- Use "CP" as an abbreviation anywhere in the knowledge base
- Assume readers know medical abbreviations
- Use abbreviations that could have multiple meanings

### Acceptable Abbreviations:
Only well-established, unambiguous classification systems:
- GMFCS (Gross Motor Function Classification System)
- MACS (Manual Ability Classification System)
- CFCS (Communication Function Classification System)
- ICD-11 (International Classification of Diseases)
- DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual)

These are acceptable because they are:
- Formal classification system names
- Unambiguous in medical contexts
- Do not have problematic alternate meanings

## Implementation

All content must:
1. Spell out "cerebral palsy" every time
2. Be reviewed for inappropriate abbreviations before publishing
3. Prioritize safety and clarity over brevity

## Note for Contributors

While "CP" is standard in medical literature, this online knowledge base prioritizes safety and clarity. This policy is non-negotiable for the protection of our users and the integrity of our content.
